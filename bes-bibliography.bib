  abstract = {This paper describes a new method to monitor continuously soil CO2 profiles using small solid-state CO2 sensors buried at different depths of the soil. Based on the measurement of soil CO2 profile and a gaseous diffusivity model, we estimated soil CO2 efflux, which was mainly from heterotrophic respiration, and its temporal variation in a dry season in a Mediterranean savanna ecosystem in California. The daily mean values of CO2 concentrations in soils had small variation, but the diurnal variation was significant and correlated well with soil temperature. The daily mean CO2 concentration remained steady at 396{$\mu$}molmol-1 at 2cm depth during the dry summer from days 200 to 235 in 2002. Over the same period, CO2 concentration decreased from 721 to 611{$\mu$}molmol-1 at 8cm depth, and from 1044 to 871{$\mu$}molmol-1 at 16cm. The vertical soil CO2 concentrations changed almost linearly with depth up to 16cm, but the gradient varied over time. Based on the soil CO2 gradient and the diffusion coefficient estimated from the Millington--Quirk model, continuous soil CO2 efflux was calculated. The daily mean values of CO2 efflux slightly decreased from 0.43 to 0.33{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 with a mean of 0.37{$\mu$}molm-2s-1. The mean diurnal range of CO2 efflux was greater than the range of daily mean CO2 efflux within the study period. The diurnal variation of soil CO2 efflux ranged from 0.32 to 0.45{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 with the peak value reached between 14:30 and 16:30h. This pattern corresponded well with the increase in soil temperatures during this time. By plotting CO2 efflux vs. soil temperature, we found that CO2 efflux correlated exponentially with soil temperature at the depth of 8cm, with R2 of 0.86 and Q10 of 1.27 in the summer dry season. The Q10 value increased with the depth of soil temperature measurements. The high correlation between CO2 efflux and temperature explains the diurnal pattern of CO2 efflux, but moisture may become another factor driving the seasonal pattern when moisture changes over seasons. The estimated CO2 efflux using this method was very close to chamber measurements, suggesting that this method can be used for long-term continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux.},

  abstract = {Continuous measurements of soil respiration and its components help us understand diurnal and seasonal variations in soil respiration and its mechanism. We continuously measured CO2 concentration at various depths in the soil and calculated surface CO2 efflux based on CO2 gradients and diffusivity in a young ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. We determined soil respiration both in a control plot that included roots and in a trenched plot that had no roots. The difference between these plots was used to partition soil respiration into root respiration and heterotrophic respiration. We found that both CO2 concentration in the soil and surface CO2 efflux in the control plot were higher than in the trenched plot. The diurnal range of soil respiration in the trenched plot was larger than in the control. We observed dramatic pulses of soil respiration in response to rain events in summer and fall during the dry season. We modeled the seasonal variation in soil respiration without the pulses using soil temperature and moisture as driving variables and simulated soil respiration pulses using an exponential decay function in response to the volume of rain. Daily mean soil respiration peaked at 5.0{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 in the control and at 2.7{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 in the trenched plot in June before the rain pulses. Soil respiration increased from 4.9 to 8.2 and to 12.1{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 after the first and second rain events in the control, and increased from 2.2 to 4.1 and to 6.6{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 in the trenched plot. After incorporating the pulse effect, the model simulated measured data well. Annual soil respiration in 2003 was estimated as 1184gCm-2y-1. The average ratio of root over total respiration was 0.56 during the growing season and 0.16 during the non-growing season with an annual average of 0.44.},

  abstract = {Variations of gas diffusivity (ratio of gas diffusion coefficients in soil and free air, DS/D0) with air-filled porosity ({$\varepsilon$}) influence the transport, degradation, and volatilization of reactive gasses in soil systems. We show that the prediction accuracy of the Penman-Millington-Quirk (PMQ) diffusivity model (introduced in Part VII of this series) is often improved significantly by including as a reference point a measured value of the gas diffusion coefficient (Dfc) at a single soil-water potential, {$\psi$}, between -100 and -500 cm H20. As a result, the root mean square error of prediction was reduced by 45\% (based on individual DS/D0 measurements) and by {$\geq$} 65\% (based on mean values of 6 to 9 closely-spaced DS/D0 measurements) for undisturbed soil samples from six differently textured surface soils. Gas permeability is measured more easily and more rapidly than gas diffusivity, and we suggest that a measured value of gas permeability (kfc) at a single soil-water potential, combined with a tortuous tube permeability model and the PMQ diffusivity model, can also be used to improve DS/D0 predictions. For practical use, a relation between the equivalent tube radius (rfc) at {$\psi$} = -100 cm H20 and clay content, taken to represent the soil structure-forming ability, is proposed for surface soils. Gas diffusive transport simulations using the DARC numerical model (Part I of this series) verified that the inclusion of a single (Dfc or kfc) measurement in the DS/D0({$\varepsilon$}) predictions can improve simulation accuracy significantly. Dfc- and kfc-based diffusivity models require limited measurement effort and seem promising for site-specific simulations of gas diffusion and reaction.},

  abstract = {The magnitude and dynamics of soil gaseous fluxes play critical roles in the global gas balance; yet, these processes are not captured at sufficient temporal resolution by standard methods based on periodic sampling and surface chamber measurements. A novel method for continuous measurement of soil surface gas fluxes based on subsurface CO2 and O2 concentration gradient measurements was developed. We tested the gradient-based method under steady- and transient-state soil water content and temperature conditions and compared results with a state-of-the-art surface chamber CO2 flux system. The new aspects of the method include fast-response sensors installed in the soil profile providing continuous record of concentration gradients coupled with concurrent estimates of water content-dependent gaseous diffusion coefficient enabling calculation of surface gaseous fluxes. Low-cost infrared sensors were used for CO2 concentration measurements, and galvanic cells for O2 measurements. An imposed CO2 concentration gradient in a dry soil column resulted in a quasilinear CO2 concentration profile and surface CO2 flux in agreement with chamber-measured fluxes. A series of continuous concentration measurements under variable water content conditions and wetting events showed agreement with surface chamber measurements. Within several days of surface wetting, soil CO2 concentrations attained 10 mL L-1, one order of magnitude higher than ambient concentrations, whereas O2 concentrations decreased. The gradient-based approach minimizes soil surface perturbations and provides insights into subsurface soil CO2 and O2 dynamics and the distribution and magnitude of soil respiration processes as related to soil environmental factors. The subsurface gradient-based measurement system represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in cost compared with research-grade surface chamber devices.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2 products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, and Earth system models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textpm}1{$\sigma$}.  For the year 2022, EFOS increased by 0.9 \% relative to 2021, with fossil emissions at 9.9{\textpm}0.5 Gt C yr-1 (10.2{\textpm}0.5 Gt C yr-1 when the cement carbonation sink is not included), and ELUC was 1.2{\textpm}0.7 Gt C yr-1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 11.1{\textpm}0.8 Gt C yr-1 (40.7{\textpm}3.2 Gt CO2 yr-1). Also, for 2022, GATM was 4.6{\textpm}0.2 Gt C yr-1 (2.18{\textpm}0.1 ppm yr-1; ppm denotes parts per million), SOCEAN was 2.8{\textpm}0.4 Gt C yr-1, and SLAND was 3.8{\textpm}0.8 Gt C yr-1, with a BIM of -0.1 Gt C yr-1 (i.e. total estimated sources marginally too low or sinks marginally too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2022 reached 417.1{\textpm}0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2023 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2022 of +1.1 \% (0.0 \% to 2.1 \%) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 419.3 ppm, 51 \% above the pre-industrial level (around 278 ppm in 1750). Overall, the mean of and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959--2022, with a near-zero overall budget imbalance, although discrepancies of up to around 1 Gt C yr-1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows the following: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade.  This living-data update documents changes in methods and data sets applied to this most recent global carbon budget as well as evolving community understanding of the global carbon cycle.

This review focuses on progress in understanding Rs from laboratory incubations to global estimates. We survey key developments of in situ ecosystem-scale Rs observations and manipulations, synthesize Rs meta-analyses and global flux estimates, and discuss the most compelling challenges and opportunities for the future. Increasingly sophisticated lab experiments have yielded insights into the interaction among heterotrophic respiration, substrate supply, and enzymatic kinetics, and extended incubation-based analyses across space and time. Observational and manipulative field-based experiments have used improved measurement approaches to deepen our understanding of the integrated effects of environmental change and disturbance on Rs. Freely-available observational databases have enabled meta-analyses and studies probing the magnitude of, and constraints on, the global Rs flux. Key challenges for the field include expanding Rs measurements, experiments, and opportunities to under-represented communities and ecosystems; reconciling independent estimates of global respiration fluxes and trends; testing and leveraging the power of machine learning and process-based models, both independently and in conjunction with each other; and continuing the field's tradition of using novel experiments to explore diverse mechanisms and ecosystems.},

A dominant component of this flux is heterotrophic respiration, influenced by several environmental factors, most notably soil temperature and moisture. Here, we develop a mechanistic model from micro to global scale to explore how changes in soil water content and temperature affect soil heterotrophic respiration. Simulations, laboratory measurements, and field observations validate the new approach. Estimates from the model show that heterotrophic respiration has been increasing since the 1980s at a rate of about 2\% per decade globally. Using future projections of surface temperature and soil moisture, the model predicts a global increase of about 40\% in heterotrophic respiration by the end of the century under the worst-case emission scenario, where the Arctic region is expected to experience a more than two-fold increase, driven primarily by declining soil moisture rather than temperature increase.},

Here, we evaluated variation in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) across the Chequamegon Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study AmeriFlux core site cluster in the upper Great Lakes region of the USA from 1997 to 2020. The tower network included two mature hardwood forests with differing management regimes (US-WCr and US-Syv), two fen wetlands with varying levels of canopy sheltering and vegetation (US-Los and US-ALQ), and a very tall (400 m) landscape-level tower (US-PFa). Together, they provided over 70 site-years of observations. The 19-tower Chequamegon Heterogenous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 campaign centered around US-PFa provided additional information on the spatial variation of NEE. Decadal variability was present in all long-term sites, but cross-site coherence in interannual NEE in the earlier part of the record became weaker with time as non-climatic factors such as local disturbances likely dominated flux time series. Average decadal NEE at the tall tower transitioned from carbon source to sink to near neutral over 24 years. Respiration had a greater effect than photosynthesis on driving variations in NEE at all sites. Declining snowfall offset potential increases in assimilation from warmer springs, as less-insulated soils delayed start of spring green-up. Higher CO2 increased maximum net assimilation parameters but not total gross primary productivity. Stand-scale sites were larger net sinks than the landscape tower. Clustered, long-term carbon flux observations provide value for understanding the diverse links between carbon and climate and the challenges of upscaling these responses across space.},

  abstract = {The response of soil carbon represents one of the key uncertainties in future climate change. The ability of Earth system models (ESMs) to simulate present-day soil carbon is therefore vital for reliably estimating global carbon budgets required for Paris Agreement targets. In this study CMIP6 ESMs are evaluated against empirical datasets to assess the ability of each model to simulate soil carbon and related controls: net primary productivity (NPP) and soil carbon turnover time ({$\tau$}s). Comparing CMIP6 with the previous generation of models (CMIP5), a lack of consistency in modelled soil carbon remains, particularly the underestimation of northern high-latitude soil carbon stocks. There is a robust improvement in the simulation of NPP in CMIP6 compared with CMIP5; however, an unrealistically high correlation with soil carbon stocks remains, suggesting the potential for an overestimation of the long-term terrestrial carbon sink. Additionally, the same improvements are not seen in the simulation of {$\tau$}s. These results suggest that much of the uncertainty associated with modelled soil carbon stocks can be attributed to the simulation of below-ground processes, and greater emphasis is required on improving the representation of below-ground soil processes in future developments of models. These improvements would help to reduce the uncertainty in projected carbon release from global soils under climate change and to increase confidence in the carbon budgets associated with different levels of global warming.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) anchors global terrestrial productivity and food and fiber supply. SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is also decomposed by microbes, returning CO2, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and agricultural practices. To understand its structure and function and to maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above- and belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive stabilization at depths greater than {$\sim$}30 cm. Global uncertainties in the amounts and locations of SOM include the extent of wetland, peatland, and permafrost systems and factors that constrain soil depths, such as shallow bedrock. In consideration of these uncertainties, we estimate global SOC stocks at depths of 2 and 3 m to be between 2,270 and 2,770 Pg, respectively, but could be as much as 700 Pg smaller. Sedimentary deposits deeper than 3 m likely contain \&gt;500 Pg of additional SOC. Soils hold the largest biogeochemically active terrestrial carbon pool on Earth and are critical for stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, global pressures on soils continue from changes in land management, including the need for increasing bioenergy and food production.},

  abstract = {The Evaluation of Measurement Data - Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (usually referred to as the GUM) provides general rules for evaluating and expressing uncertainty in measurement. When a measurand, y, is calculated from other measurements through a functional relationship, uncertainties in the input variables will propagate through the calculation to an uncertainty in the output y. The manner in which such uncertainties are propagated through a functional relationship provides much of the mathematical challenge to fully understanding the GUM., The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of the GUM and to show how the calculation of uncertainty in the measurand may be achieved through a functional relationship. That is, starting with the general equation for combining uncertainty components as outlined in the GUM, we show how this general equation can be applied to various functional relationships in order to derive a combined standard uncertainty for the output value of the particular function (the measurand). The GUM equation may be applied to any mathematical form or functional relationship (the starting point for laboratory calculations) and describes the propagation of uncertainty from the input variable(s) to the output value of the function (the end point or outcome of the laboratory calculation). A rule-based approach is suggested with a number of the more common rules tabulated for the routine calculation of measurement uncertainty.},

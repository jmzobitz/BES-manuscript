# Introduction
Soils contain the largest reservoir of terrestrial carbon [@jobbagyVerticalDistributionSoil2000].
Accumulation of soil organic matter can be influenced by biotic factors from aboveground plant inputs [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017], which in turn are influenced through environmental factors such as growing season length, temperature, and moisture [@desaiDriversDecadalCarbon2022]. These biotic factors provide natural climate-based solutions to offsetting any net increases of the terrestrial carbon cycle from greenhouse gas emissions [@friedlingsteinGlobalCarbonBudget2023]. 


Ecological networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON, ) and others (e.g.FLUXNET or the Integrated Carbon Observation System) present a significant advancement in the nearly continuous observation of biogeochemical processes at the continental scale. Notably, at 47 sites across the continental United States NEON provides half-hourly measurements of soil carbon content, soil CO$_{2}$ concentration, temperature, and moisture at different vertical depths. In turn, FLUXNET provides measurements of the cumulative sum of all ecosystem carbon fluxes in an airshed using the eddy covariance technique [@baldocchiMeasuringFluxesTrace2014]. Soil observations from NEON data provided by NEON is on the same timescale and standardized with eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET. When combined together NEON and FLUXNET data reconciling differences between
model-derived or data-estimated components [@luoEcologicalForecastingData2011; @phillipsValueSoilRespiration2017; @shaoBioticClimaticControls2015; @shaoSoilMicrobialRespiration2013; @sihiComparingModelsMicrobial2016; @jianHistoricallyInconsistentProductivity2022].

Beyond observations of soil CO$_{2}$ concentrations or other environmental variables such as moisture or temperature, a key quantity is soil carbon fluxes [@bond-lambertyTwentyYearsProgress2024]. A soil carbon flux to the atmosphere ($F_{S}$, units $\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) represents the aggregate process of transfer of soil CO$_{2}$ to the atmosphere from physical and biological processes (e.g. diffusion and microbial and autotrophic respiration). Soil carbon fluxes can be coupled with empirical or process models of soil carbon. Soil carbon fluxes can be assumed to represent soil carbon respiration from autotrophic or heterotrophic sources [@davidson_variability_2006], typically assumed to be static across the soil biome and modeled with a exponential $Q_{10}$ paradigm [@bond-lamberty_contribution_2004-1; @chen_does_2005; @hamdi_synthesis_2013]. 



Measurement of $F_{S}$ is done through directly with soil chambers (e.g. LICOR or XXXX) or from soil measurements at different depths in the soil. In the latter case, the flux-gradient approach derives from the mass conservation from the vertical soil depth $z$ at steady state by applying Fick's law of diffusion. A simplifying assumption for the flux-gradient method is no mass transfer in the other spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$ [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]. The diffusivity profile across the soil depth is a function of soil temperature, soil volumetric water content, atmospheric air pressure, and soil bulk density [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971; @moldrupModelingDiffusionReaction1999].

A growing number of databases such as the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) or Continuous Soil Respiration Database (COSORE) add to the growing network of observations of soil fluxes [@bond-lambertyCOSORECommunityDatabase2020; @jianRestructuredUpdatedGlobal2021; @jiangGlobalSoilRespiration2024; @bond-lambertyGlobalDatabaseSoil2010; @bond-lambertyNewTechniquesData2018]. Currently NEON provides all measurements to calculuate $F_{S}$ from Fick's law, but it was descoped from the initial network launch [@berenbaumReportNSFBIO2015]. Deriving data-based measurements of $F_{S}$ is a high priority.

This study describes efforts to derive a standardized estimate of $F_{S}$ at all terrestrial NEON sites. Derived values of $F_{S}$ are then validated from a subset of field observations. Key objectives of this study are to:

- apply the flux-gradeint method to measurement to current NEON sites
- benchmark produced soil carbon fluxes to other ancillary measusrements (e.g. SRDB, measurements of soil respiration)
- identify sources of error for future work.



# Materials and Methods

## Study sites (NEEDS REVISING)
We selected six terrestrial NEON sites for analysis. These sites span a range of environmental gradients and terrestrial domains for analysis (Table @tbl-neon_sites). Over the course of two field campaigns in 2022 and 2024 we conducted weekly visits at each site through selecting a specific in the soil sampling array, installing a temporary soil collar, and doing direct flux measurements. These data were then compared for analysis later.

IDEA: Could have a sparkline plot of temperature / precip over the course of the time spent at each site, although admittedly we didn't see THAT much variation when sampling.

## Computation of soil fluxes
We developed an R package `neonSoilFlux` https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonSoilFlux to compute a half-hourly soil carbon flux with provided NEON data. This package represents a unified workflow for observation and analysis
To compute a soil flux measurement, we acquired environmental observations and associated uncertainties from NEON servers using the `NEONUtilities` R package. Specific data products included half hourly soil water content, half-hourly soil CO$_{2}$, half-hourly atmospheric pressure, half-hourly soil temperature, and soil properties (e.g. bulk density). These static soil properties are periodically collected and assumed to be constant for the montly observation period. Each NEON observation site collects samples from three to five different spatial positions, with each position sampling at three to five different soil depths. 


The `neonSoilFlux` R package acquires the data for a given site and month and stacks observations at a soil plot into one nested list column for ease of computation, or alternatively, export measurements into a comma separate value file.  Quality flags are reported A measurement is Quality flags with an observation are reported as an indicator variable. If a given observation did is reported as not passing a quality assurance check we applied a gap filling method to replace that measurement with its monthly mean.

Following this initial data processing, temperature, soil water content were interpolated using splines to the same depth at CO$_{2}$ concentration measurements. CO$_{2}$ was converted to molar concentration ($\mu$mol m$^{-3}$).

This is illustrated well by @fig-model_diagram.


For a given half hour, we applied Fick's law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}) to estimate the soil flux $F_{s}$, units $\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$:

\begin{equation}
F_{s} = -D_{a} \frac{dC}{dz},\label{eq:ficks}
\end{equation}

where $D_{a}$ is the diffusivity (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$). Computation of $D_{a}$ equals:

\begin{equation}
\xi D_{a,0}

\end{equation}

We compute a site specific soil volume fraction ($f_{V}$, cm${^3}$ cm$^{-3}$) with particle densities of different size classes (less than 2 mm, 2-5 mm, and 5-20 mm). We assume the particle density of mineral soil ($\rho_{m}$) equals 2.65 g cm$^{-3}$.

$f_{rock} = \left(1- \frac{\rho_{Coarse}}{\rho_{m}} \right)\left(1-\frac{\rho_{2-5}}{\rho_{m}}+\frac{\rho_{5-20}}{\rho_{m}}\right)$

## Soil surface fluxes.

NEW WRITING
Using the three NEON measurements harmonized at a given depth along with an interpolated measurement of surface CO2 (through linear regression) soil fluxes were computed across each layer, according to the following convention:

We assume that the surface CO$_{2}$ flux density is a linear extrapolation of the remaining three layers [VERIFY THIS IS THE CASE].  Once this is computed we then are ready to compute the surface flux.

A soil flux measurement is reported as $F_{ijk}$, with i, j, k being 0 or 1.  The flux across a surface $F_{100}$, $F_{010}$, $F_{001}$ refer to a single soil flux across a layer.

A computation of a surface flux is linear extrapolation of the flux measurements indexed, so then $F_{101}$ is a linear extrapolation of $F_{100}$ and $F_{001}$. Any uncertainties are reported through with quadrature.  The computation of the surface flux using this method allows for the selection and investigation of different assumptions of how fluxes are computed (cite references) with a unified framework. 

Soil fluxes were computed across three different layers in the soil according to NEON measurements (see conceptual diagram)



END NEW WRITING


We computed the soil surface flux (Equation~\ref{eq:ficks}) with four different approaches [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014], outlined below. Surface fluxes were computed from the three CO$_{2}$ concentration measurement levels closest to the soil surface. Spline fits were used to infer soil temperature and soil moisture at the same measurement levels as CO$_{2}$ concentration and used to compute diffusivity at these depths. We applied quadrature to compute uncertainty at each calculation in computing diffusivity $D_{a}$ or the surface gradient $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}$.

Methodological differences are in the estimation of either the surface gradient $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}These approaches differ in terms of how the Four different approaches were used in the flux gradient method, based on a review from Maier Schack Kirchner.
De Jong and Schappert (1972) computes a linear regression of CO2 molar concentration at depth. Once that is computed, the surface gradient is then approximated by F = -D1 * (C0 - C1)/(0-z1), where (z1,C1) is the measurement depth closest to the surface. The The flux is estimated by does a linear regression for the C(z) and then uses C0 
Hirano et al (2005) also takes the linear regression to create a new vector and the center between each measurement depth C = (C0, Ci) and z = (0, zi) and then estimates the gradient at each depth. (dC/dz)_i.  A flux at each depth is computed to then extrapolate the surface concentration. [[ FILL IN MORE HERE ]]

We partition the soil into three distinct layers. Assuming that the soil profile is non-uniform, we use In computing the diffusivity to account for variation across layers (i.e. ), we use the weighted harmonic mean [@turcuContinuousSoilCarbon2005]:

\begin{equation}
D_{a;i,i+1}=\frac{z_{i+1}-z_{i}}{\frac{}}
\end{equation}


- @tangAssessingSoilCO22003 assumes that both CO$_{2}$ molar density and diffusivity increases linearly through the soil profile ($C(z)$ and $D(z)$ respectively). In Equation~\ref{eq:ficks}, $D_{a} = D(0)$ and $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}$ is the linear regression slope.

- @tangContinuousMeasurementsSoil2005


This method assumes  The advantage to this methodlinear regression assumes the co2 molar density and diffusivity increases linearly through the soil profile, so the computed surface flux is the extrapolated diffusivity times the slope of the linear regression of CO2 vs z.
Tang et al 2005 computed the mean diffusivity between two different layers and then computed the gradient at each layer for a diffusive flux.  This was then extrapolated to the surface concentration.
These four methods were then implemented along with any uncertainty analysis (found via quadrature).




Error handling
We use the fact that reported error measurements occur at a given sampling location i and depth j.  NEON reports QF flags as a binary value.  Since we want the QF for a given flux measurement to represent 0 if no measurements across depths were fine, and 1 if either a smoothed mean was used for a given depth. We assign an aggregate QF value for a given time.

Gap filling module
To compute the monthly mean we used a bootstrapped sample of measurements from the reported measurements which passed the QC and the uncertainty by bootstrapping. We assume that the measurement comes from a normally distributed distribution with mean and standard deviation. A given number of bootstrap samples are specified so that new replicate samples are created, then the mean is taken.  a measurement a specified number of times [LINK] with x + epsilon 
Assume there is a vector of means x, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval of the uncertainty. The bias in a measurement is given by the difference between the 95% confidence interval and the standard deviation in quadrature standard deviation and For a specified number of bootstrap samples.

The monthly mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is computed through bootstrapping from the available measurements that We apply a bootstrap sample for the distribution of the monthly mean measurements, and generate a sampling distribution of both the monthly mean ($\overline{\mathbf{x}}$) and standard deviation ($\mathbf{s}$) the following ways.



repeatedly sample from this bootstrap 

We compute a monthly mean at a location's spatial depth $z$ with at least 15 measurements without any quality control issues. These measurements are represented by the vector $\mathbf{m}$, standard errors $\boldsymbol\sigma$, and the 95% confidence interval (the so-called expanded uncertainty, @farranceUncertaintyMeasurementReview2012) $\boldsymbol\epsilon$. All of these vectors have length $M$. We have that $\vec{\sigma}_{i}\leq\vec{\epsilon}_{i}$.  We define the bias as $\mathbf{b}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol\epsilon^{2}-\boldsymbol\sigma^{2}}$.


We generate a vector of bootstrap samples of the distribution  of the monthly mean $\overline{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and monthly standard error $\overline{\boldsymbol\sigma}$ the following ways. Here we set the number of bootstrap samples $B$ to be 5000. Entries for both are determined by the following:

1. Randomly sample from the uncertainty and bias independently: $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$ and the bias $\mathbf{b}_{k}$ (not necessarily the same sample)
2. Generate a vector $\mathbf{n}$ of length $N$, where $\mathbf{n}_{i}$ is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{m}_{i}$ and standard deviation $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$. Since $M<N$, values from $\mathbf{m}$ will be reused.
3. With these $N$ random samples, $\overline{y}_{i}=\overline{\vec{x}}+\vec{b}_{k}$ and $s_{i}$ is the sample standard deviation of $\vec{x}$. We expect that $s_{i} \approx \vec{\sigma}_{j}$.

Once that is complete, the reported monthly mean and standard deviation is $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$.

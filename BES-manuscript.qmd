# Introduction

Soils contain the largest reservoir of terrestrial carbon [@jobbagyVerticalDistributionSoil2000]. Accumulation of soil organic matter can be influenced by biotic factors from aboveground plant inputs [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017], which in turn are influenced through environmental factors such as growing season length, temperature, and moisture [@desaiDriversDecadalCarbon2022]. These biotic factors provide natural climate-based solutions to offsetting any net increases of the terrestrial carbon cycle from greenhouse gas emissions [@friedlingsteinGlobalCarbonBudget2023].

Ecological networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and others (e.g. FLUXNET or the Integrated Carbon Observation System) present a significant advancement in the nearly continuous observation of biogeochemical processes at the continental scale. Notably, at 47 core terrestrial sites across the continental United States NEON provides half-hourly measurements of soil carbon content, soil CO$_{2}$ concentration, temperature, and moisture at different vertical depths. In turn, FLUXNET provides measurements of the cumulative sum of all ecosystem carbon fluxes in an airshed using the eddy covariance technique [@baldocchiMeasuringFluxesTrace2014]. Soil observations from NEON data provided by NEON is on the same timescale and standardized with eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET. When combined together NEON and FLUXNET data reconciling differences between model-derived or data-estimated components [@luoEcologicalForecastingData2011; @phillipsValueSoilRespiration2017; @shaoBioticClimaticControls2015; @shaoSoilMicrobialRespiration2013; @sihiComparingModelsMicrobial2016; @jianHistoricallyInconsistentProductivity2022].

Beyond observations of soil CO$_{2}$ concentrations or other environmental variables such as moisture or temperature, a key quantity is soil carbon fluxes [@bond-lambertyTwentyYearsProgress2024]. A soil carbon flux to the atmosphere ($F_{S}$, units $\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) represents the aggregate process of transfer of soil CO$_{2}$ to the atmosphere from physical and biological processes (e.g. diffusion and microbial and autotrophic respiration). Soil carbon fluxes can be coupled with empirical or process models of soil carbon. Soil carbon fluxes can be assumed to represent soil carbon respiration from autotrophic or heterotrophic sources [@davidsonVariabilityRespirationTerrestrial2006], typically assumed to be static across the soil biome and modeled with a exponential $Q_{10}$ paradigm [@bond-lambertyGlobalRelationshipHeterotrophic2004; @chenDoesGeneralTemperatureDependent2005; @hamdiSynthesisAnalysisTemperature2013].

Measurement of $F_{S}$ is done through directly with soil chambers (e.g. LICOR or XXXX) or from soil measurements at different depths in the soil. In the latter case, the flux-gradient method is an approach derives from the mass conservation from the vertical soil depth $z$ at steady state by applying Fick's law of diffusion. A simplifying assumption for the flux-gradient method is that there no mass transfer in the other spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$ [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]. The diffusivity profile across the soil depth is a function of soil temperature, soil volumetric water content, atmospheric air pressure, and soil bulk density [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971; @moldrupModelingDiffusionReaction1999].

A growing number of databases such as the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) or Continuous Soil Respiration Database (COSORE) add to the growing network of observations of soil fluxes [@bond-lambertyCOSORECommunityDatabase2020; @jianRestructuredUpdatedGlobal2021; @jiangGlobalSoilRespiration2024; @bond-lambertyGlobalDatabaseSoil2010; @bond-lambertyNewTechniquesData2018]. Currently NEON provides all measurements to calculuate $F_{S}$ from Fick's law, but it was descoped from the initial network launch [@berenbaumReportNSFBIO2015]. Deriving data-based measurements of $F_{S}$ is a high priority.

This study describes efforts to derive a standardized estimate of $F_{S}$ at all terrestrial NEON sites. Derived values of $F_{S}$ are then validated from a subset of field observations. Key objectives of this study are to:

-   apply the flux-gradeint method to measurement to current NEON sites
-   benchmark produced soil carbon fluxes to other ancillary measusrements (e.g. SRDB, measurements of soil respiration)
-   identify sources of error for future work.

# Materials and Methods

## Study sites

We selected six terrestrial NEON sites for analysis. These sites span a range of environmental gradients and terrestrial domains for analysis (@tbl-neon-sites). Over the course of two field campaigns in 2022 and 2024 we conducted weekly visits at each site through selecting a specific in the soil sampling array, installing a temporary soil collar, and doing direct flux measurements. These data were then compared for analysis later.

Listing of NEON sites studied for field work and analysis

:::

IDEA: Could have a sparkline plot of temperature / precip over the course of the time spent at each site, although admittedly we didn't see THAT much variation when sampling.

## Field methods

In order to acquire field data to validate model predictions of flux, we conducted field measurement campaigns at the siz core terrestrial NEON sites listed above. SJER, SRER, and WREF were visited during May and June of 2022, and WOOD, KONZ, and UNDE during May and June of 2024. We spent a week at each site, taking daily measurements of flux on an hourly or half-hourly interval after letting soil collar(s) equilibrate for approximately 24 hours.

### Soil collar placement

Either one (2022 sampling campaign) or two (2024 sampling campaign) PVC soil collars (FIXME: diameter) were installed in close proximity to the permanent NEON soil sensors at each site. The soil plot where measurements was taken was chosen at each site in consultation with NEON staff to maximize likelihood of quality soil sensor measurements during the duration of the IRGA measurements at each site.

IDEA: Add graphic of soil plot layout and placement of soil collar(s) -- could make diagram in OmniGraffle?

### Infrared gas analyzer measurements of soil CO$_{2}$ flux

During the summer 2022 field campaign, a LI-COR 6800 with soil flux chamber attachment was used to measure soil fluxes for 8 hours each day on an hourly interval. During the summer 2024 field campaign, the LI-6800 measurements were taken on a half-hourly interval and were paired with an automated soil flux chamber setup (FIXME multiplexer, IRGA, chamber model numbers) that made automated measurements on a half-hourly interval 24 hours a day while we were on site. Each instrument was paired with a soil temperature and moisture probe (FIXME: Stevens model #) that was used to make soil temperature and moisture measurements concurrent with the CO$_{2}$ flux measurements.

Dead bands, measurement duration, instrument self-testing.

### Post-collection processing of data

## neonSoilFlux R package

We developed an R package (`neonSoilFlux`; https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonSoilFlux) to compute half-hourly soil carbon fluxes and uncertainties from NEON data. The objective of the `neonSoilFlux` package is a unified workflow soil data acquisition and analysis that supplements existing data acquisition software through the `neonUtilities` R package ([https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonUtilities](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonUtilities)). @fig-package-diagram outlines the basic workflow of the package. 

::: {#fig-package-diagram}
![](figures/neonSoilFluxOutline.png)

Diagram of `neonSoilFlux` R package. For a given month and NEON site, the package acquires all relevant data to compute $F_{S}$ using the `neonUtilities` R package. Data are gap-filled according to reported QA flags and interpolated to the same measurement depth before computing the soil flux, uncertainties, and final QA flags.
:::

At a given NEON observation there are five different replicate soil sensor arrays, with each sampling at five different soil depths (@fig-model-diagram). The `neonSoilFlux` package acquires measured soil water content [@neonSoilWater], soil CO$_{2}$ concentration [@neonSoilCO2], barometric pressure [@neonBarometricPressure], soil temperature [@neonSoilTemp], and soil properties (e.g. bulk density) [@neonSoilProperties]. The static soil properties are periodically collected and assumed to be constant for the monthly observation period.  

::: {#fig-model-diagram}
![](figures/model-diagram.pdf){fig-alt="Diagram of model workflow"}

Model diagram for data workflow for the neonSoilFlux R package. a) Acquire: Data are obtained from given NEON location and horizontal sensor location, which includes soil water content, soil temperature, CO$_{2}$ concentration, and atmospheric pressure. All data are screened for quality assurance, with gap-filling of missing data reported. b) Any belowground data are then harmonized to the same depth as CO$_{2}$ concentrations using linear regression. c) The flux across a given depth is computed via Fick's law, denoted with $F_{ijk}$, where $i$, $j$, or $k$ are either 0 or 1 denoting the layer the flux is computed across ($i$ = closest to surface, $k$ = deepest). The surface flux is all possible combinations of $F_{ijk}$ extrapolating the flux measurements to the surface, so $F_{110}$ is the surface flux intercept linearly extrapolating the measurements $F_{010}$ and $F_{100}$.
:::

The workflow to computing a value of $F_{S}$ with the `neonSoilFlux` consists of three primary steps. First, NEON data are acquired for a given site and month via the `neonUtilities` R package (yellow parallelogram and green rectangle in @fig-package-diagram and Panel a in @fig-model-diagram). Acquired environmental data can be exported to a comma separated value file for additional analysis. Quality assurance (QA) flags with an observation are reported as an indicator variable.

The next step is harmonizing the data to compute soil fluxes across soil layers. This step consists of three different actions (blue rectangles in  @fig-package-diagram and Panel b in @fig-model-diagram). If a given observation did is reported as not passing a quality assurance check we applied a gap filling method to replace that measurement with its monthly mean at that same depth (@sec-gapfilling). Belowground measurements of soil water and soil temperature are then interpolated to the same depth as soil CO$_{2}$ measurements. The diffusivity (@sec-compute-diffusivity) and soil flux across different soil layers (@sec-compute-soil-flux) are then computed.

The final step is computing a surface soil flux through extrapolation to the surface (purple parallelogram in @fig-package-diagram and Panel c in @fig-model-diagram). Uncertainty on a soil flux measurement is computed through quadrature. An aggregate QA flag for each environmental measurement is also reported, representing if any gap-filled measurements were used in the computation of a soil flux. Within the soil flux-gradient method, several different approaches can be used to derive a surface flux [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]; the `neonSoilFlux` package reports eight different possible values of soil surface flux (@sec-compute-soil-flux). 

### Gap-filling routine {#sec-gapfilling}

NEON reports QA flags as a binary value for a given measurement and half-hourly time. We replaced any flagged measurements at a location's spatial depth $z$ with a bootstrapped sample of the monthly mean for all un-flagged measurements for that month. hese measurements are represented by the vector $\mathbf{m}$, standard errors $\boldsymbol\sigma$, and the 95% confidence interval (the so-called expanded uncertainty, @farranceUncertaintyMeasurementReview2012) $\boldsymbol\epsilon$. All of these vectors have length $M$. We have that $\vec{\sigma}_{i}\leq\vec{\epsilon}_{i}$. We define the bias as $\mathbf{b}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol\epsilon^{2}-\boldsymbol\sigma^{2}}$.

We generate a vector of bootstrap samples of the distribution of the monthly mean $\overline{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and monthly standard error $\overline{\boldsymbol\sigma}$ the following ways:

1.  Randomly sample from the uncertainty and bias independently: $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$ and the bias $\mathbf{b}_{k}$ (not necessarily the same sample)
2.  Generate a vector $\mathbf{n}$ of length $N$, where $\mathbf{n}_{i}$ is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{m}_{i}$ and standard deviation $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$. Since $M<N$, values from $\mathbf{m}$ will be reused.
3.  With these $N$ random samples, $\overline{y}_{i}=\overline{\vec{x}}+\vec{b}_{k}$ and $s_{i}$ is the sample standard deviation of $\vec{x}$. We expect that $s_{i} \approx \vec{\sigma}_{j}$.
4. The reported monthly mean and standard deviation are then computed $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$. Measurements and uncertainties that did not pass the QA check are then substituted with $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$.

### Diffusivity computation {#sec-compute-diffusivity}

Soil diffusivity $D_{a}$ at a given measurement depth is the product of the diffusivity in free air $D_{a,0}$ (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$) and the tortuosity $\xi$ (no units) [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971]. Surface barometric pressure (kPa) [@neonBarometricPressure], soil temperature at depth [@neonSoilTemp], soil water content [@neonSoilWater], and soil physical properties [@neonSoilProperties]. Soil physical properties are surveyed once at each site, whereas the other measurements are provided on a half-hourly basis.

We compute $D_{a,0}$ with Equation \ref{eq:da0}:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  D_{a,0} = 0.0000147 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{i} + 273.15}{293.15} \right)^{1.75} \cdot \left( \frac{P}{101.3} \right)
  \label{eq:da0}
\end{equation}
```

where $T_{i}$ is soil temperature ($^\circ$C) at depth $i$ [@neonSoilTemp] and $P$ surface barometric pressure (kPa) [@neonBarometricPressure]. At that soil depth, the tortuosity $\xi$ is defined by Equation \ref{eq:tortuosity} [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971]:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  \xi = \frac{(\phi - SWC_{i})^{10/3}}{\phi^{2}}
  \label{eq:tortuosity}
\end{equation}
```

In Equation \ref{eq:tortuosity}, $SWC$ is the soil water content at depth $i$ [@neonSoilWater] and $\phi$ is the porosity (Equation \ref{eq:porosity}), which in turn is a function of soil physical properties [@neonSoilProperties].

The tortuosity $\xi$ is computed from soil porosity $\phi$.  : 

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \left(1- \frac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{m}} \right) \left(1-f_{V}\right)
  \label{eq:porosity}
\end{equation}
```

In Equation \ref{eq:porosity}, $\rho_{m}$ is the particle density of mineral soil (2.65 g cm$^{-3}$), $\rho_{s}$ the soil bulk density (g cm$^{-3}$) excluding coarse fragments greater than 2 mm [@neonSoilProperties]. The term $f_{V}$ is a site-specific value that accounts for the proportion of soil fragments between 2-20 mm. Soil fragments greater than 20 mm were not estimated due to limitations in the amount of soil that can be analyzed [@neonSoilProperties]. We assume there are no pores within rocks. Values of $\rho_{s}$, $\rho_{m}$ are assumed to be constant across the soil profile and the same at each site sampling location.

### Soil flux computation {#sec-compute-soil-flux}

We applied Fick's law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}) to compute the soil flux $F_{ij}$ ($\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) across two adjacent soil depths $i$ and $j$:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  F_{ij} = -D_{a} \frac{dC}{dz}
  \label{eq:ficks}
\end{equation}
```

where $D_{a}$ is the diffusivity (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$) and $\frac{dC}{dz}$ is the gradient of CO$_{2}$ molar concentration ($\mu$mol m$^{-3}$, so the gradient has units of $\mu$mol m$^{-3}$ m$^{-1}$). The diffusivity (described below) is a function of soil temperature, soil water content, and soil physical properties. The soil surface flux is theoretically defined by applying Equation \ref{eq:ficks} to measurements collected at the soil surface and directly below the surface. Measurements of soil temperature, soil water content, and soil CO$_{2}$ molar concentration across the soil profile allow for application of Equation \ref{eq:flux} across different soil depths. The flux gradient method approximates the soil surface flux either by (1) extrapolation of Equation \ref{eq:ficks} across sub-surface measurement depths to the surface, typically assuming soil flux is a linear function of depth [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014] or (2) linear extrapolation of $D_{a}$ to the surface and from direct calculation of $\frac{dC}{dz}$ from the CO$_{2}$ profile. All these approaches are pThe `neonSoilFlux` package provides several different methods to compute $F_{s}$ for the end-user to compare.

### Reporting of surface fluxes

A surface flux estimate is derived from Fick's Law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}), which is the product of a diffusivity and a CO$_{2}$ concentration gradient [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]. The `neonSoilFlux` package provides eight different surface flux estimates, which represent different considerations of how Fick's Law is applied. First, we apply simple linear regression to both CO$_{2}$ and $D_{a}$ at the three different measurement depths. Next, the slope and intercept (and uncertainty by quadrature) from these regressions are used to compute a suite of eight different surface flux estimates (denoted by $F_{ijk}$):

-   $F_{000}$ is a surface flux estimate using the intercept of the linear regression of $D_{a}$ and the slope from linear regression of CO$_{2}$ (which represents $\frac{dC}{dz}$ in Fick's Law). @tangAssessingSoilCO22003 used this approach to compute fluxes in an oak-grass savannah.
-   $F_{010}$, $F_{001}$ are fluxes across the two most shallow layers and two deepest layers respectively. The diffusivity used in Fick's Law is always at the deeper measurement layer. When used as a surface flux estimate we assume CO$_{2}$ remains constant above this flux depth.
-   $F_{100}$ is a flux estimate where the gradient $\frac{dC}{dz}$ is estimated using the intercept from linear regression of CO$_{2}$ and the top measurement depth for CO$_{2}$. The diffusivity used in Fick's Law is always at the first measurement layer. @dejongCalculationSoilRespiration1972 applied this approach in a Canadian prairie.
-   $F_{110}$, $F_{101}$, $F_{011}$ are a surface flux estimates using linear extrapolation between $F_{100}$ and $F_{010}$; $F_{100}$ and $F_{001}$; or $F\_{010}$ and $F_{001}$ respectively. @hirano_long-term_2003 and @tangContinuousMeasurementsSoil2005 used an approach similar to $F_{101}$ in a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest and ponderosa pine forest respectively.
-   $F_{111}$ is a surface flux estimate using linear extrapolation between $F_{100}$, $F_{010}$, and $F_{001}$.

Uncertainty in all $F_{ijk}$ is computed through quadrature.

## Model Results

Figure @flux-results reports out the measured fluxes from the LICOR 6800 and 8250 and computed fluxes and uncertainty at each measurement site. Results are reported in local time. Positive values of the flux indicate that there is a flux moving towards the surface (FIX WRITING) For ease of clarity the fluxes at $F_{111}$ and $F_{000}$ are only shown in the top row (surface), followed by the fluxes at individual separate layer ($F_{100}$, $F_{010}$, $F_{001}$). Overall, with the exception of WREF and SRER (discussed later) the computed fluxes were on the same order of magnitude and timing as the measured field fluxes.

Results for different flux computations, organized by site (in increasing temperature show at each site) across different measurement levels. $F_{000}$ comes from the diffusivity extrapolation and $F_{111}$ extrapolation across the surface. Field measurements are shown at the top of each plot. The computed flux values are shown with reported uncertainty as well.
:::

We evaluate the efficacy of results from the flux-gradient method in two ways. First, we calculated the signal to noise ratio (SNR), defined as the ratio of the reported flux to its uncertainty ($F_{ijk}/\sigma_{ijk}$).

We evaluated if the measured field fluxes were within the calculated uncertainty from the flux-gradient method using the various approaches outlined above. We observed that the calculated quadrature uncertainty in many cases can be much larger than the reported measurement (as shown through the signal to noise ratio, SNR = $F_{ijk}/\sigma_{ijk}$. We evaluated $| F_{S} - F_{ijk} | < (1-\epsilon) \sigma_{ijk}$, where $F_{S}$ is a measured field soil flux (LICOR 6800 or LICOR 8250) and $F_{ijk}$ is a computed flux method from the flux-gradient, and $\sigma_{ijk}$ is the reported uncertainty for the flux method.  The parameter $\epsilon$ was an uncertainty reduction factor to evaluate how sensitive the results were given, measured by the proportion of field measurements contained in that range.  These results are reported in @fig-uncertainty-stats.

We also computed the diffusivity at each of the different sites from the derived flux values and the reported gradient in CO2 at each of the surface layers (Figure XXXX) through dividing $F_{field}/dC/dz$  These values were then compared to reported diffusivity from the flux computation method.

# Discussion

- CO2 concentration and flux
This study presents a unified data science workflow to efficiently process automated measurements of belowground soil CO$_{2}$ concentrations, water, and temperature to infer estimates of soil effluxes through application of Fick's Law. Derived results from the `neonSoilFlux` package have patterns that are consistent, and comparable, to those directly measured to the field.  The advantage to the `neonSoilFlux` package is the calculation of fluxes across different measurement depths, allowing for additional site-specific customization.  This package extends the type of measurements available from NEON. (Tie back to introduction how this is a high priority ...).

John wonders: Can we make a probability argument here?
We have 4 sensors, each with probabilty rate p_i. (assume the same)
We pick one at random, what is the chance that it is one that failed?

How many ways can we have 1 sensor that failed? 4 choose 1,
4 choose 2, 4 choose 3, 4 choose 4, 4 choose 0
p

Probability of none, at least k.
Each instrument has a failure rate of k, they are independent

The largest source of uncertainty to improve reliability of the flux estimate is to prevent the usage of gap-filled data. While laudable, this goal may be impossible in practice. Across the observed half-hourly periods for field measurements, the percentage of half-hourly periods where all four environmental measurements were avaialbe spanned from 0% (SJER) to 7% (SRER). We applied a statistical gap-filling routine to provide a reasonable estimate.  The gap-filling routineThe uncertainty in the derived fluxes can be reduced through several different mechanisms.  First, the reliability of the belowground soil water measurements can be improved. Where appropriate we have replaced measurements flagged to the protocol with a monthly gap-filled mean.

The results reported from the flux-gradient method provide a robust framework for data processing and evaluation of fluxes across different layers (Figure XXX).  Each of the single flux layers $F_{001}$, $F_{010}$, $F_{100}$ allow for the user to diagnose valid conditions of the flux gradient method are held to produce a surface flux, namely an increasing CO$_{2}$ gradient as depth from surface increases.  Building on the tidyverse framework we leave it up to the user to identify and see if certain site-specific conditions are necessary to further refine the fluxes (or if a combination of one approach or the other is needed).

The methods employed in this paper have been utilized in other approaches throughout the literature, namely XXX, YYY, and ZZZ.  However with this study we have the processing of soil fluxes that could be extrapolated and applied across an entire measurement network.  Future studies can extrapolate this out addiitonally to allow for either site-specific validation and measurement.

The validation approaches espoused in this study highlight the critical need for success of this approach to utilize robust measurements of soil temperature and soil water to capture the dynamic, half-hourly changes in soil carbon fluxes for the surface.  No site had 

Evaluation of flux gradient approaches.
This project showed the feasibility of incorporating below ground measurements of co2 supplemented with soil moisture and temperature to infer approximately correctly values of belowground soil co2 respiration.  While there is literature applying the flux gradient method across different ecosystems (cite references) this is the first study of this type to compute soil fluxes with a common framework in a collection of measurement sites.

In terms of cost and benefit the flux gradient method provides a passive way to measure CO2 fluxes compared to the maintenance and equipment costs of soil co2 chambers or automated measurements like the LICOR.  Clearly there is more work to be done in to reducing uncertainty, but the methods shown here provide a framework for additional model reduction and uncertianty.

The figure So this suggests that the neonSoilFlux method has low accuracy (bummer). While 1:1 plots provide a comparison, I think I need to go a little deeper.  The issue is that the computed uncertainty from neonSoilFlux tends to be larger than the observed field variability (which you saw in the timeseries), and arguably is indefensible for a soil flux.

It got me thinking about the signal to noise ratios for neonSoilFlux (top panel below):
uncertainty-stats.png
What the SNR shows is that for the two soil flux methods that incorporate information across all the layers, they do tend to be pretty noisy (SNR > 1).

I also wondered if the computed uncertainty is an overestimate, how much could we reduce the uncertainty and still have the field measurements within a reported range from neonSoilFlux?  That calculation is shown in the bottom panels above where epsilon is the uncertainty reduction factor.  If epsilon = 0, that means we are just using the reported uncertainty from neonSoilFlux.  Looking at that (epsilon = 0) shows field measurements UNDE, KONZ, SJER are 100% within the reported intervals from neonSoilFlux.  But those sites tend to have a SNR < 1, so the uncertainty is pretty noisy.  For UNDE, we could even reduce the uncertainty by a factor of 75% (epsilon = 0.75), more than half of the field measurements will still be within the reported intervals.  For  KONZ, we are still within 70% of the reported intervals when uncertainty is reduced by 90%.  To me, that suggests that while the reported accuracy (as compared to field measurements), we do have higher precision.

The flux gradient method could be improved with more dynamic measurements of soil water and temperature.  Across the sites, soil water was a primary factor controlling the accuracy of the reported fluxes.  



TABLE REPORTING HALF HOURLY PERIODS DURING VALIDATION SCHEME - Or plot.

Across all the sites soil water content was not reported to the half hour (did not pass QC filtering test in `neonSoilFlux`). Part of this is calibration issues with the sensors. We expect that sites will be online and working.

- Temperature and moisture controls on respiration
- Evaluation of methods to estimate soil respiration
- Uncertainty reduction and what is the "correct" answer

Diffusivity taken from the megapit.  Big microsite and temporal differences, soil shrink / swell.  How do we think about what that means for using this approach to generalize across a NEON site over continuous time.

- Back calculation of bulk density to NEON sites.

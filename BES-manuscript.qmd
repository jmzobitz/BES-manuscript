# Introduction

Soils contain the largest reservoir of terrestrial carbon [@jobbagyVerticalDistributionSoil2000]. A critical component of this reservoir is soil organic matter, the accumulation of which is influenced by biotic factors such as above-ground plant inputs [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017]. These inputs in turn are influenced by environmental factors such as growing season length, temperature, and moisture [@desaiDriversDecadalCarbon2022], which also affect the breakdown of soil organic matter and its return to the atmosphere. Across heterogeneous terrestrial landscapes, the interplay between these biotic and abiotic factors influence the size of the soil contribution to the terrestrial carbon sink  [@friedlingsteinGlobalCarbonBudget2023]. However, the heterogeneity of these processes across diverse ecosystems in the context of rapid environmental change leads to large uncertainty in the magnitude of this sink in the future, and thus a pressing need to quantify changes in soil carbon pools and fluxes across scales.

Ecological observation networks such as the United States' National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and others (e.g. FLUXNET or the Integrated Carbon Observation System) present a significant advancement in the nearly continuous observation of biogeochemical processes at the continental scale. Notably, at 47 core terrestrial sites across the continental United States, NEON provides half-hourly measurements of soil carbon content, soil CO$_{2}$ concentration, temperature, and moisture at different vertical depths. In turn, FLUXNET provides measurements of the cumulative sum of all ecosystem carbon fluxes in an airshed using the eddy covariance technique [@baldocchiMeasuringFluxesTrace2014]. Soil observations provided by NEON are on the same timescale and standardized with eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET. <!-- What about NEON flux towers? This framing seems to suggest they aren't useful/extant? --> When combined together, NEON and FLUXNET data can be used to reconcile differences between model-derived or data-estimated components [@luoEcologicalForecastingData2011; @phillipsValueSoilRespiration2017; @shaoBioticClimaticControls2015; @shaoSoilMicrobialRespiration2013; @sihiComparingModelsMicrobial2016; @jianHistoricallyInconsistentProductivity2022].

Beyond direct observations of soil CO$_{2}$ concentrations and other environmental variables such as moisture or temperature, soil carbon fluxes are a key metric for understanding change in soil carbon pools over time [@bond-lambertyTwentyYearsProgress2024]. A soil carbon flux to the atmosphere ($F_{S}$, units $\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$), represents the aggregate process of transfer of soil CO$_{2}$ to the atmosphere from physical and biological processes (e.g. diffusion and respiration). Measurements of soil carbon fluxes can be coupled with empirical or process models of soil carbon. Soil carbon fluxes can be assumed to encompass soil carbon respiration from autotrophic or heterotrophic sources [@davidsonVariabilityRespirationTerrestrial2006], typically assumed to be static across the soil biome and modeled with a exponential $Q_{10}$ paradigm [@bond-lambertyGlobalRelationshipHeterotrophic2004; @chenDoesGeneralTemperatureDependent2005; @hamdiSynthesisAnalysisTemperature2013].

Measurement of $F_{S}$ is done through directly with soil chambers in a closed system with an infrared gas analyzer (e.g. <!-- LICOR or XXXX insert models etc here and maybe find some more citations--> ) or estimated from soil CO$_{2}$ measurements at different depths in the soil. In the latter case, the flux-gradient method can be used to estimate soil flux; it is an approach that is uses conservation of mass to calculate flux at a vertical soil depth $z$ at steady state by applying Fick's law of diffusion. A simplifying assumption for the flux-gradient method is that there no mass transfer in the other spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$ [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]. The diffusivity profile, a key component of this calculation, varies across the soil depth as a function of soil temperature, soil volumetric water content, atmospheric air pressure, and soil bulk density [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971; @moldrupModelingDiffusionReaction1999].

A growing number of databases such as the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) or Continuous Soil Respiration Database (COSORE) add to the growing network of observations of soil fluxes [@bond-lambertyCOSORECommunityDatabase2020; @jianRestructuredUpdatedGlobal2021; @jiangGlobalSoilRespiration2024; @bond-lambertyGlobalDatabaseSoil2010; @bond-lambertyNewTechniquesData2018]. Currently, NEON provides all measurements to calculate $F_{S}$ from Fick's law, but soil flux as a derived data product was descoped from the initial network launch [@berenbaumReportNSFBIO2015]. Deriving data-based estimates of $F_{S}$ across NEON sites thus represents a high priority.

This study describes efforts to develop an R software package, \textit{neonSoilFlux}, that can be used to derive a standardized estimate of $F_{S}$ at all terrestrial NEON sites. After calculating these flux estimates, we then validated them against field observations from a subset of sites.

Key objectives of this study are to:

-   apply the flux-gradient method to measurement to current NEON sites
-   benchmark produced soil carbon fluxes to other ancillary measurements (e.g. SRDB, measurements of soil respiration)
-   identify sources of error for future work

# Materials and Methods

## Study sites

We selected six terrestrial NEON sites for analysis. These sites span a range of environmental gradients and terrestrial domains for analysis (@tbl-neon-sites). Over the course of two field campaigns in 2022 and 2024 we conducted weekly visits at each site through selecting a specific in the soil sampling array, installing a temporary soil collar, and doing direct flux measurements. These data were then compared for analysis later.

## Field methods

In order to acquire field data to validate model predictions of flux, we conducted field measurement campaigns at the siz core terrestrial NEON sites listed above. SJER, SRER, and WREF were visited during May and June of 2022, and WOOD, KONZ, and UNDE during May and June of 2024. We spent a week at each site, taking daily measurements of flux on an hourly or half-hourly interval after letting soil collar(s) equilibrate for approximately 24 hours.

### Soil collar placement

Either one (2022 sampling campaign) or two (2024 sampling campaign) PVC soil collars (FIXME: diameter) were installed in close proximity to the permanent NEON soil sensors at each site. The soil plot where measurements was taken was chosen at each site in consultation with NEON staff to maximize likelihood of quality soil sensor measurements during the duration of the IRGA measurements at each site.

IDEA: Add graphic of soil plot layout and placement of soil collar(s) -- could make diagram in OmniGraffle?

### Infrared gas analyzer measurements of soil CO$_{2}$ flux

During the summer 2022 field campaign, a LI-COR 6800 with soil flux chamber attachment was used to measure soil fluxes for 8 hours each day on an hourly interval. During the summer 2024 field campaign, the LI-6800 measurements were taken on a half-hourly interval and were paired with an automated soil flux chamber setup (FIXME multiplexer, IRGA, chamber model numbers) that made automated measurements on a half-hourly interval 24 hours a day while we were on site. Each instrument was paired with a soil temperature and moisture probe (FIXME: Stevens model #) that was used to make soil temperature and moisture measurements concurrent with the CO$_{2}$ flux measurements.

Dead bands, measurement duration, instrument self-testing.

### Post-collection processing of data

LI-COR SoilFluxPro software to assess dead band and measurement duration. 

## neonSoilFlux R package

We developed an R package (`neonSoilFlux`; https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonSoilFlux) to compute half-hourly soil carbon fluxes and uncertainties from NEON data. The objective of the `neonSoilFlux` package is a unified workflow soil data acquisition and analysis that supplements existing data acquisition software through the `neonUtilities` R package ([https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonUtilities](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonUtilities)). @fig-package-diagram outlines the basic workflow of the package. 

::: {#fig-package-diagram}
![](figures/neonSoilFluxOutline.png)

Diagram of `neonSoilFlux` R package. For a given month and NEON site, the package acquires all relevant data to compute $F_{S}$ using the `neonUtilities` R package. Data are gap-filled according to reported QA flags and interpolated to the same measurement depth before computing the soil flux, uncertainties, and final QA flags.
:::

At a given NEON observation there are five different replicate soil sensor arrays, with each sampling at five different soil depths (@fig-model-diagram). The `neonSoilFlux` package acquires measured soil water content [@neonSoilWater], soil CO$_{2}$ concentration [@neonSoilCO2], barometric pressure [@neonBarometricPressure], soil temperature [@neonSoilTemp], and soil properties (e.g. bulk density) [@neonSoilProperties]. The static soil properties are periodically collected and assumed to be constant for the monthly observation period.

Model diagram for data workflow for the `neonSoilFlux` R package. a) Acquire: Data are obtained from given NEON location and horizontal sensor location, which includes soil water content, soil temperature, CO$_{2}$ concentration, and atmospheric pressure. All data are screened for quality assurance, with gap-filling of missing data reported. b) Any belowground data are then harmonized to the same depth as CO$_{2}$ concentrations using linear regression. c) The flux across a given depth is computed via Fick's law, denoted with $F_{ijk}$, where $i$, $j$, or $k$ are either 0 or 1 denoting the layers the flux is computed across ($i$ = closest to surface, $k$ = deepest). $F_{000}$ represents a flux estimate where the gradient $dC/dz$ is the slope of a linear regression of CO$_{2}$ with depth.
:::

The workflow to computing a value of $F_{S}$ with the `neonSoilFlux` consists of three primary steps. First, NEON data are acquired for a given site and month via the `neonUtilities` R package (yellow parallelogram and green rectangle in @fig-package-diagram and Panel a in @fig-model-diagram). Acquired environmental data can be exported to a comma separated value file for additional analysis. Quality assurance (QA) flags with an observation are reported as an indicator variable.

The next step is harmonizing the data to compute soil fluxes across soil layers. This step consists of three different actions (blue rectangles in  @fig-package-diagram and Panel b in @fig-model-diagram). If a given observation did is reported as not passing a quality assurance check we applied a gap filling method to replace that measurement with its monthly mean at that same depth (@sec-gapfilling). Belowground measurements of soil water and soil temperature are then interpolated to the same depth as soil CO$_{2}$ measurements. The diffusivity (@sec-compute-diffusivity) and soil flux across different soil layers (@sec-compute-soil-flux) are then computed.

The final step is computing a surface soil flux through extrapolation to the surface (purple parallelogram in @fig-package-diagram and Panel c in @fig-model-diagram). Uncertainty on a soil flux measurement is computed through quadrature. An aggregate quality assurance (QA) flag for each environmental measurement is also reported, representing if any gap-filled measurements were used in the computation of a soil flux. Within the soil flux-gradient method, several different approaches can be used to derive a surface flux [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]; the `neonSoilFlux` package reports eight different possible values of soil surface flux (@sec-compute-soil-flux). 

### Gap-filling routine {#sec-gapfilling}

NEON reports QA flags as a binary value for a given measurement and half-hourly time. We replaced any flagged measurements at a location's spatial depth $z$ with a bootstrapped sample of the monthly mean for all un-flagged measurements for that month. These measurements are represented by the vector $\mathbf{m}$, standard errors $\boldsymbol\sigma$, and the 95% confidence interval (the so-called expanded uncertainty, @farranceUncertaintyMeasurementReview2012) $\boldsymbol\epsilon$. All of these vectors have length $M$. We have that $\vec{\sigma}_{i}\leq\vec{\epsilon}_{i}$. We define the bias as $\mathbf{b}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol\epsilon^{2}-\boldsymbol\sigma^{2}}$.

We generate a vector of bootstrap samples of the distribution of the monthly mean $\overline{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and monthly standard error $\overline{\boldsymbol\sigma}$ the following ways:

1.  Randomly sample from the uncertainty and bias independently: $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$ and the bias $\mathbf{b}_{k}$ (not necessarily the same sample)
2.  Generate a vector $\mathbf{n}$ of length $N$, where $\mathbf{n}_{i}$ is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{m}_{i}$ and standard deviation $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$. Since $M<N$, values from $\mathbf{m}$ will be reused.
3.  With these $N$ random samples, $\overline{y}_{i}=\overline{\vec{x}}+\vec{b}_{k}$ and $s_{i}$ is the sample standard deviation of $\vec{x}$. We expect that $s_{i} \approx \vec{\sigma}_{j}$.
4. The reported monthly mean and standard deviation are then computed $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$. Measurements and uncertainties that did not pass the QA check are then substituted with $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$.

### Diffusivity computation {#sec-compute-diffusivity}

Soil diffusivity $D_{a}$ at a given measurement depth is the product of the diffusivity in free air $D_{a,0}$ (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$) and the tortuosity $\xi$ (no units) [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971]. Surface barometric pressure (kPa) [@neonBarometricPressure], soil temperature at depth [@neonSoilTemp], soil water content [@neonSoilWater], and soil physical properties [@neonSoilProperties]. Soil physical properties are surveyed once at each site, whereas the other measurements are provided on a half-hourly basis.

We compute $D_{a,0}$ with Equation \ref{eq:da0}:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  D_{a,0} = 0.0000147 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{i} + 273.15}{293.15} \right)^{1.75} \cdot \left( \frac{P}{101.3} \right)
  \label{eq:da0}
\end{equation}
```

where $T_{i}$ is soil temperature ($^\circ$C) at depth $i$ [@neonSoilTemp] and $P$ surface barometric pressure (kPa) [@neonBarometricPressure]. At that soil depth, the tortuosity $\xi$ is defined by Equation \ref{eq:tortuosity} [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971]:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  \xi = \frac{(\phi - SWC_{i})^{10/3}}{\phi^{2}}
  \label{eq:tortuosity}
\end{equation}
```

In Equation \ref{eq:tortuosity}, $SWC$ is the soil water content at depth $i$ [@neonSoilWater] and $\phi$ is the porosity (Equation \ref{eq:porosity}), which in turn is a function of soil physical properties [@neonSoilProperties].

The tortuosity $\xi$ is computed from soil porosity $\phi$.  : 

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \left(1- \frac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{m}} \right) \left(1-f_{V}\right)
  \label{eq:porosity}
\end{equation}
```

In Equation \ref{eq:porosity}, $\rho_{m}$ is the particle density of mineral soil (2.65 g cm$^{-3}$), $\rho_{s}$ the soil bulk density (g cm$^{-3}$) excluding coarse fragments greater than 2 mm [@neonSoilProperties]. The term $f_{V}$ is a site-specific value that accounts for the proportion of soil fragments between 2-20 mm. Soil fragments greater than 20 mm were not estimated due to limitations in the amount of soil that can be analyzed [@neonSoilProperties]. We assume there are no pores within rocks. Values of $\rho_{s}$, $\rho_{m}$ are assumed to be constant across the soil profile and the same at each site sampling location.

### Soil flux computation {#sec-compute-soil-flux}

We applied Fick's law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}) to compute the soil flux $F_{ij}$ ($\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) across two soil depths $i$ and $j$:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  F_{ij} = -D_{a} \frac{dC}{dz}
  \label{eq:ficks}
\end{equation}
```

where $D_{a}$ is the diffusivity (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$) and $\frac{dC}{dz}$ is the gradient of CO$_{2}$ molar concentration ($\mu$mol m$^{-3}$, so the gradient has units of $\mu$mol m$^{-3}$ m$^{-1}$). The diffusivity (described below) is a function of soil temperature, soil water content, and soil physical properties. The soil surface flux is theoretically defined by applying Equation \ref{eq:ficks} to measurements collected at the soil surface and directly below the surface. Measurements of soil temperature, soil water content, and soil CO$_{2}$ molar concentration across the soil profile allow for application of Equation \ref{eq:flux} across different soil depths. The flux gradient method approximates the soil surface flux either by (1) computation Equation \ref{eq:ficks} across sub-surface measurement depths to the surface. Each site had three measurement layers, so we denote the flux between which two layers as a three-digit subscript $F_{ijk}$ where indicator variables indicating if a given layer was used (written in order of increasing depth), according to the following:

-   $F_{000}$ is a surface flux estimate using the intercept of the linear regression of $D_{a}$ and the slope from linear regression of CO$_{2}$ (which represents $\frac{dC}{dz}$ in Fick's Law). @tangAssessingSoilCO22003 used this approach to compute fluxes in an oak-grass savannah.
-   $F_{110}$, $F_{011}$ are fluxes across the two most shallow layers and two deepest layers respectively. The diffusivity used in Fick's Law is always at the deeper measurement layer. When used as a surface flux estimate we assume CO$_{2}$ remains constant above this flux depth.
-   $F_{101}$ is a surface flux estimate using linear extrapolation using concentration measurements between the shallowest and deepest measurement layer. @hirano_long-term_2003 and @tangContinuousMeasurementsSoil2005 used an approach similar to $F_{101}$ in a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest and ponderosa pine forest respectively.

Uncertainty in all $F_{ijk}$ is computed through quadrature.

## Post processing evaluation

Following collection of field measurements from the LICOR and calculation of the soil fluxes from `neonSoilFlux` package, we compared measured soil fluxes (from the LICOR instruments) to a given soil flux calculation during the same half hour.  At each site and flux compuation method we also computed the R$^{2}$ value for the half-hourly and measured LICOR values and the RMSE.

We evaluate the efficacy of results from the flux-gradient method in two ways. First, we calculated the signal to noise ratio (SNR), defined as the ratio of the reported flux to its uncertainty ($F_{ijk}/\sigma_{ijk}$).

We evaluated if the measured field fluxes were within the calculated uncertainty from the flux-gradient method using the various approaches outlined above. We observed that the calculated quadrature uncertainty in many cases can be much larger than the reported measurement (as shown through the signal to noise ratio, SNR = $F_{ijk}/\sigma_{ijk}$. We evaluated $| F_{S} - F_{ijk} | < (1-\epsilon) \sigma_{ijk}$, where $F_{S}$ is a measured field soil flux from the LICOR 6800 (the LICOR 8250 was used at only three sites) and $F_{ijk}$ is a computed flux method from the flux-gradient, and $\sigma_{ijk}$ is the reported uncertainty for the flux method.  The parameter $\epsilon$ was an uncertainty reduction factor to evaluate how sensitive the results were given, measured by the proportion of field measurements contained in that range.  

## Diffusivity back calculations

We also computed the diffusivity at each of the different sites from the derived flux values and the reported gradient in CO2 at each of the surface layers (Figure XXXX) through dividing $F_{field}/dC/dz$  These values were then compared to reported diffusivity from the flux computation method.

Finally, the bulk density at a given site was then also computed through back calculation.

# Results

@fig-flux-results reports out the measured fluxes from the LICOR 6800 and 8250 and computed fluxes and uncertainty at each measurement site. Results are reported in local time. Positive values of the flux indicate that there is a flux moving towards the surface. For ease of clarity the fluxes at $F_{111}$ and $F_{000}$ are only shown in the top row (surface), followed by the fluxes at individual separate layer ($F_{100}$, $F_{010}$, $F_{001}$). Overall, with the exception of WREF and SRER (discussed later) the computed fluxes were on the same order of magnitude and timing as the measured field fluxes.

# Discussion

<!-- discussion sketch begin -->

This study presents a unified data science workflow to efficiently process automated measurements of belowground soil CO$_{2}$ concentrations, water, and temperature to infer estimates of soil effluxes through application of Fick's Law (Equation XXX). Our core goals in this study were: (1) to generate estimates of soil flux from continuous soil sensor data at terrestrial NEON sites using the flux-gradient method and then (2) to compare those estimates to field-measured fluxes based on the closed chamber approach at six focal sites across a coordinate measurement network NEON. We will evaluate the core goals through (1) an overall evaluation of the flux-gradient approach (and uncertainty calculation) and (2) site-specific evaluation for differences in fluxes.


## Evaluation of flux-gradient approach at each site

Key assumptions of the flux-gradient approach are that CO$_{2}$ concentrations increase throughout the soil profile. We found that this condition was met at XXX% across the study period. Periods where this gradient condition are not met generally are connected to biophysical processes such soil wetting events (e.g. KONZ), which have the effect of temporarily reducing the soil respiration or efflux.  For modeling soil respiration, typically a non-linear response function is considered, that also considers soil type as well [@boumaAssessmentRootSoil2000; @yanPorescaleInvestigationResponse2016; @yanMoistureFunctionSoil2018].  For the `neonSoilFlux` package soil type is connected to the bulk density, which is separately determined / measured at a site.

The largest source of uncertainty to improve reliability of the flux estimate is to prevent the usage of gap-filled data, especially with soil water (Figure XXX). Across the observed half-hourly periods for field measurements, the percentage of half-hourly periods where all four environmental measurements were available spanned from 0% (SJER) to 7% (SRER), but three sites (WREF, SRER, UNDE) had 95% of half-hourly intervals with just one gap-filled measurement.Where appropriate we have replaced measurements flagged to the protocol with a monthly gap-filled value. Further extensions of the gapfilling method could use more sophisticated gap-filling routines, similar to what is used for net ecosystem carbon exchange [@falgeGapFillingStrategies2001; @moffatComprehensiveComparisonGapfilling2007; @mariethozFeaturepreservingInterpolationFiltering2015; @liuRobustGapfillingApproach2023; @zhangTemporalGapFilling12Hourly2023].

Diffusivity taken from the megapit.  Big microsite and temporal differences, soil shrink / swell.  How do we think about what that means for using this approach to generalize across a NEON site over continuous time.

## Site specific evaluation

Across all the site

The six sites studied provide separate case studies for considerations when applying the flux-gradient method to evaluate resulting uncertainties and fluxes.  SRER is characterized by sandy soil, which also led to the hottest site there.  Fluxes are driven by the change and response to temperature in the temperature driven, whereas we observed a decoupling of temperature across the different layers (supplementary figures?)  For this instance, using the flux across the top two layers ($F_{110}$) produced a pattern of soil flux consistent with the observed field data.  The remaining methods $F_{101}$, $F_{011}$, or $F_{000}$ are derived from information at the deeper layer, which is decoupled both in terms of temperature and CO$_{2}$ concentration.

KONZ is a site that experienced a significant rain event prior to sampling with eventual drying out over the course of the experiment.  In this case we observed storage of soil water (as shown in supplementary figures), which increased the soil CO$_{2}$ at the top layer, leading to negative values of flux at the start of the experiment, with the fluxes drying out afterards.  In this case only when the soil dried out (or returned to a baseline level), that the fluxes at the provided layer would work out in this case.

WREF experienced a generational rainfall leading up the point of measuring, which meant that sensors relied of gap-filled data.  In this case, $F_{000}$ is the better one.
We were able to show that the flux-gradient method produced estimates within XX of the field measured values at X of Y sites.

TANG 2003 noticed a similar pattern in temperature as SRER
Mention alternative diffusivity calculations? (Sallam - but this may not be a factor compared to water availability and gap filling)

When considering systematic deployment of this method across a measurement network, we faced a number of independent challenges for consideration.  In developing and validating our approach, we faced a number of challenges related to data availability, including... gap filling, sensor calibration, depth interpolation, rainstorms, etc  These errors are all 

 Derived results from the `neonSoilFlux` package have patterns that are consistent, and comparable, to those directly measured to the field (Figure XXX).  The advantage to the `neonSoilFlux` package is the calculation of fluxes across different measurement depths, allowing for additional site-specific customization. Here application of the flux-gradient method provides a baseline estimate of soil fluxes that could be complemented through additional field measurements (e.g. LICOR).

## Recommendations for future method development

The `neonSoilFlux` package provides three different approaches of values for a soil flux. We believe these approaches reflect a variety of site-specific determination and assumptions used to generate a soil flux measurement [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014], with the choice of method having a determinative approach on reported values. Reported results could further be distilled down using ensemble averaging averaging approaches [@rafteryUsingBayesianModel2005; @elshallRelativeModelScore2018].

Figures XXX suggests that the provided uncertainty from `neonSoilFlux` is an overestimate compared to what is actually computed. When $\epsilon=0$ in Figure @fig-uncertainty-stats, that means we are just using the reported uncertainty from neonSoilFlux.  Looking at that (epsilon = 0) shows field measurements UNDE, KONZ, SJER are 100% within the reported intervals from neonSoilFlux.  But those sites tend to have a SNR < 1, so the uncertainty is pretty noisy.  For UNDE, we could even reduce the uncertainty by a factor of 75% (epsilon = 0.75), more than half of the field measurements will still be within the reported intervals.  For  KONZ, we are still within 70% of the reported intervals when uncertainty is reduced by 90%.  To me, that suggests that while the reported accuracy (as compared to field measurements), we do have higher precision.

These challenges notwithstanding, the method used here and made available in the `neonSoilFlux` R package is able to produce nearly continuous estimates of flux across all XXYY terrestrial NEON sites. These estimates are a significant improvement on available approaches to constrain the portion of ecosystem respiration attributable to the soil. This, in turn, aids in our ability to understand the components of net ecosystem flux assessed at these sites using the co-located eddy flux towers.

- Refine estimates to provide a realistic constraint on surface concentration measurements, thereby increasing the gradient.
- Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g. random trees) or model averaging techniques to generate a single flux estimate across each sites spatial location
- Benchmarking flux results to estimates provided by Net ecosystem carbon exchange.

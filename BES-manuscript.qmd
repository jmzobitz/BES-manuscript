# Introduction

Soils contain the largest reservoir of terrestrial carbon [@jobbagyVerticalDistributionSoil2000]. Accumulation of soil organic matter can be influenced by biotic factors from aboveground plant inputs [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017], which in turn are influenced through environmental factors such as growing season length, temperature, and moisture [@desaiDriversDecadalCarbon2022]. These biotic factors provide natural climate-based solutions to offsetting any net increases of the terrestrial carbon cycle from greenhouse gas emissions [@friedlingsteinGlobalCarbonBudget2023].

Ecological networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON, ) and others (e.g.FLUXNET or the Integrated Carbon Observation System) present a significant advancement in the nearly continuous observation of biogeochemical processes at the continental scale. Notably, at 47 sites across the continental United States NEON provides half-hourly measurements of soil carbon content, soil CO$_{2}$ concentration, temperature, and moisture at different vertical depths. In turn, FLUXNET provides measurements of the cumulative sum of all ecosystem carbon fluxes in an airshed using the eddy covariance technique [@baldocchiMeasuringFluxesTrace2014]. Soil observations from NEON data provided by NEON is on the same timescale and standardized with eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET. When combined together NEON and FLUXNET data reconciling differences between model-derived or data-estimated components [@luoEcologicalForecastingData2011; @phillipsValueSoilRespiration2017; @shaoBioticClimaticControls2015; @shaoSoilMicrobialRespiration2013; @sihiComparingModelsMicrobial2016; @jianHistoricallyInconsistentProductivity2022].

Beyond observations of soil CO$_{2}$ concentrations or other environmental variables such as moisture or temperature, a key quantity is soil carbon fluxes [@bond-lambertyTwentyYearsProgress2024]. A soil carbon flux to the atmosphere ($F_{S}$, units $\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) represents the aggregate process of transfer of soil CO$_{2}$ to the atmosphere from physical and biological processes (e.g. diffusion and microbial and autotrophic respiration). Soil carbon fluxes can be coupled with empirical or process models of soil carbon. Soil carbon fluxes can be assumed to represent soil carbon respiration from autotrophic or heterotrophic sources [@davidson_variability_2006], typically assumed to be static across the soil biome and modeled with a exponential $Q_{10}$ paradigm [@bond-lamberty_contribution_2004-1; @chen_does_2005; @hamdi_synthesis_2013].

Measurement of $F_{S}$ is done through directly with soil chambers (e.g. LICOR or XXXX) or from soil measurements at different depths in the soil. In the latter case, the flux-gradient approach derives from the mass conservation from the vertical soil depth $z$ at steady state by applying Fick's law of diffusion. A simplifying assumption for the flux-gradient method is no mass transfer in the other spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$ [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]. The diffusivity profile across the soil depth is a function of soil temperature, soil volumetric water content, atmospheric air pressure, and soil bulk density [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971; @moldrupModelingDiffusionReaction1999].

A growing number of databases such as the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) or Continuous Soil Respiration Database (COSORE) add to the growing network of observations of soil fluxes [@bond-lambertyCOSORECommunityDatabase2020; @jianRestructuredUpdatedGlobal2021; @jiangGlobalSoilRespiration2024; @bond-lambertyGlobalDatabaseSoil2010; @bond-lambertyNewTechniquesData2018]. Currently NEON provides all measurements to calculuate $F_{S}$ from Fick's law, but it was descoped from the initial network launch [@berenbaumReportNSFBIO2015]. Deriving data-based measurements of $F_{S}$ is a high priority.

This study describes efforts to derive a standardized estimate of $F_{S}$ at all terrestrial NEON sites. Derived values of $F_{S}$ are then validated from a subset of field observations. Key objectives of this study are to:

-   apply the flux-gradeint method to measurement to current NEON sites
-   benchmark produced soil carbon fluxes to other ancillary measusrements (e.g. SRDB, measurements of soil respiration)
-   identify sources of error for future work.

# Materials and Methods

## Study sites

We selected six terrestrial NEON sites for analysis. These sites span a range of environmental gradients and terrestrial domains for analysis (Table @tbl-neon_sites). Over the course of two field campaigns in 2022 and 2024 we conducted weekly visits at each site through selecting a specific in the soil sampling array, installing a temporary soil collar, and doing direct flux measurements. These data were then compared for analysis later.

IDEA: Could have a sparkline plot of temperature / precip over the course of the time spent at each site, although admittedly we didn't see THAT much variation when sampling.

## Field methods

## neonSoilFlux R package
We developed an R package (`neonSoilFlux`; https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonSoilFlux) to compute half-hourly soil carbon fluxes and uncertainties from NEON data. The objective of the `neonSoilFlux` package is a unified workflow soil data acquisition and analysis that supplements existing data acquisition software through the `neonUtilities` R package ([https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonUtilities](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonUtilities)).

 At a given NEON observation there are five different replicate soil sensor arrays, with each sampling at five different soil depths. The `neonSoilFlux` package acquires measured soil water content [@neonSoilWater], soil CO$_{2}$ concentration [@neonSoilCO2], barometric pressure [@neonBarometricPressure], soil temperature [@neonSoilTemp], and soil properties (e.g. bulk density) [@neonSoilProperties]. The static soil properties are periodically collected and assumed to be constant for the montly observation period. 

The `neonSoilFlux` consists of two primary functions: (1) acquiring the NEON data for a given site and month via the `neonUtilities` R package (green rectangle in Figure @package_diagram) and (2) computing the surface flux from the environmental data (blue rectangles in Figure @package_diagram).  Acquired environmental data can be exported to a comma separated value file for additional analysis. Quality assurance (QA) flags with an observation are reported as an indicator variable. If a given observation did is reported as not passing a quality assurance check we applied a gap filling method to replace that measurement with its monthly mean (described below).

Data are gap-filled according to reported QA flags and interpolated to the same measurement depth before computing the soil flux, uncertainties, and final QA flags.

This is illustrated well by @fig-model_diagram.

### Gap-filling routine
NEON reports QA flags as a binary value for a given measurement and half-hourly time. We replaced any flagged measurements at a location's spatial depth $z$ with a bootstrapped sample of the monthly mean for all un-flagged measurements for that month. hese measurements are represented by the vector $\mathbf{m}$, standard errors $\boldsymbol\sigma$, and the 95% confidence interval (the so-called expanded uncertainty, @farranceUncertaintyMeasurementReview2012) $\boldsymbol\epsilon$. All of these vectors have length $M$. We have that $\vec{\sigma}_{i}\leq\vec{\epsilon}_{i}$. We define the bias as $\mathbf{b}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol\epsilon^{2}-\boldsymbol\sigma^{2}}$.


We generate a vector of bootstrap samples of the distribution of the monthly mean $\overline{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and monthly standard error $\overline{\boldsymbol\sigma}$ the following ways:

1.  Randomly sample from the uncertainty and bias independently: $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$ and the bias $\mathbf{b}_{k}$ (not necessarily the same sample)
2.  Generate a vector $\mathbf{n}$ of length $N$, where $\mathbf{n}_{i}$ is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{m}_{i}$ and standard deviation $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$. Since $M<N$, values from $\mathbf{m}$ will be reused.
3.  With these $N$ random samples, $\overline{y}_{i}=\overline{\vec{x}}+\vec{b}_{k}$ and $s_{i}$ is the sample standard deviation of $\vec{x}$. We expect that $s_{i} \approx \vec{\sigma}_{j}$.
4. The reported monthly mean and standard deviation are then computed $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$. Measurements and uncertainties that did not pass the QA check are then substituted with $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$.




### Soil flux computation
We applied Fick's law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}) to compute the soil flux $F_{s}$ ($\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) across two soil depths:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
F_{s} = -D_{a} \frac{dC}{dz},\label{eq:ficks}
\end{equation}
```
where $D_{a}$ is the diffusivity (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$) and $\frac{dC}{dz}$ is the gradient of CO$_{2}$ molar concentration ($\mu$mol m$^{-3}$, so the gradient has units of $\mu$mol m$^{-3}$ m$^{-1}$). The diffusivity (described below) is a function of soil temperature, soil water content, and soil physical properties. The soil surface flux is theoretically defined by applying Equation~\ref{eq:ficks} to measurements collected at the soil surface and directly below the surface. Measurements of soil temperature, soil water content, and soil CO$_{2}$ molar concentration across the soil profile allow for application of Equation~\ref{eq:flux} across different soil depths. The flux gradient method approximates the soil surface flux either by (1) extrapolation of Equation~\ref{eq:ficks} across sub-surface measurement depths to the surface, typically assuming soil flux is a linear function of depth [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014] or (2) linear extrapolation of $D_{a}$ to the surface and from direct calculation of $\frac{dC}{dz}$ from the CO$_{2}$ profile. All these approaches are pThe `neonSoilFlux` package provides several different methods to compute $F_{s}$ for the end-user to compare.

### Diffusivity computation
Soil diffusivity $D_{a}$ at a given measurement depth is the product of the diffusivity in free air $D_{a,0}$ (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$) and the tortuosity $\xi$ (no units) [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971].  We compute $D_{a,0}$ with Equation~\ref{eq:da0}:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  D_{a,0} = 0.0000147 \cdot \left( \frac{T + 273.15}{293.15} \right)^{1.75} \cdot \left( \frac{P}{101.3} \right),\label{eq:da0}
```

where $T$ is soil temperature ($^\circ}$C) [@neonSoilTemp] and $P$ barometric pressure (kPa) [@neonBarometricPressure].

The tortuosity $\xi$ is a function of soil physical properties [@neonSoilProperties] and soil water content [@neonSoilWater].

We compute a site specific soil volume fraction ($f_{V}$, cm${^3}$ cm$^{-3}$) with particle densities of different size classes (less than 2 mm, 2-5 mm, and 5-20 mm). We assume the particle density of mineral soil ($\rho_{m}$) equals 2.65 g cm$^{-3}$.

$f_{rock} = \left(1- \frac{\rho_{Coarse}}{\rho_{m}} \right)\left(1-\frac{\rho_{2-5}}{\rho_{m}}+\frac{\rho_{5-20}}{\rho_{m}}\right)$

The soil particle density is assumed to be 2.65 g cm\^-3 CO2 in molar density computed.

### Reporting of surface fluxes

A surface flux estimate is derived from Fick's Law (Equation\~\ref{eq:ficks}), which is the product of a diffusivity and a CO$_{2}$ concentration gradient [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]. The `neonSoilFlux` package provides eight different surface flux estimates, which represent different considerations of how Fick's Law is applied. First, we apply simple linear regression to both CO$_{2}$ and $D_{a}$ at the three different measurement depths. Next, the slope and intercept (and uncertainty by quadrature) from these regressions are used to compute a suite of eight different surface flux estimates (denoted by $F_{ijk}$):

-   $F_{000}$ is a surface flux estimate using the intercept of the linear regression of $D_{a}$ and the slope from linear regression of CO$_{2}$ (which represents $\frac{dC}{dz}$ in Fick's Law). @tangAssessingSoilCO22003 used this approach to compute fluxes in XXX
-   $F_{010}$, $F_{001}$ are fluxes across the two most shallow layers and two deepest layers respectively. The diffusivity used in Fick's Law is always at the deeper measurement layer. When used as a surface flux estimate we assume CO$_{2}$ remains constant above this flux depth.
-   $F_{100}$ is a flux estimate where the gradient $\frac{dC}{dz}$ is estimated using the intercept from linear regression of CO$_{2}$ and the top measurement depth for CO$_{2}$. The diffusivity used in Fick's Law is always at the first measurement layer. @dejongCalculationSoilRespiration1972 applied this approach.
-   $F_{110}$, $F_{101}$, $F_{011}$ are asurface flux estimates using linear extrapolation between $F_{100}$ and $F_{010}$; $F_{100}$ and $F_{001}$; or \$F\_{010} and $F_{001}$ respectively.
-   $F_{111}$ is a surface flux estimate using linear extrapolation between $F_{100}$, $F_{010}$, and $F_{001}$.

Uncertainty in all $F_{ijk}$ is computed through quadrature.

The surface flux is all possible combinations of $F_{ijk}$ extrapolating the flux measurements to the surface, so $F_{110}$ is the surface flux intercept linearly extrapolating the measurements $F_{010}$ and $F_{100}$.

END NEW WRITING

We computed the soil surface flux (Equation\~\ref{eq:ficks}) with four different approaches [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014], outlined below. Surface fluxes were computed from the three CO$_{2}$ concentration measurement levels closest to the soil surface. Spline fits were used to infer soil temperature and soil moisture at the same measurement levels as CO$_{2}$ concentration and used to compute diffusivity at these depths. We applied quadrature to compute uncertainty at each calculation in computing diffusivity $D_{a}$ or the surface gradient $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}$.

Methodological differences are in the estimation of either the surface gradient \$\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}These approaches differ in terms of how the Four different approaches were used in the flux gradient method, based on a review from Maier Schack Kirchner. De Jong and Schappert (1972) computes a linear regression of CO2 molar concentration at depth. Once that is computed, the surface gradient is then approximated by F = -D1 \* (C0 - C1)/(0-z1), where (z1,C1) is the measurement depth closest to the surface. The The flux is estimated by does a linear regression for the C(z) and then uses C0 Hirano et al (2005) also takes the linear regression to create a new vector and the center between each measurement depth C = (C0, Ci) and z = (0, zi) and then estimates the gradient at each depth. (dC/dz)\_i. A flux at each depth is computed to then extrapolate the surface concentration. \[\[ FILL IN MORE HERE \]\]

We partition the soil into three distinct layers. Assuming that the soil profile is non-uniform, we use In computing the diffusivity to account for variation across layers (i.e. ), we use the weighted harmonic mean [@turcuContinuousSoilCarbon2005]:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
D_{a;i,i+1}=\frac{z_{i+1}-z_{i}}{\frac{}}
\end{equation}
```
-   @tangAssessingSoilCO22003 assumes that both CO$_{2}$ molar density and diffusivity increases linearly through the soil profile ($C(z)$ and $D(z)$ respectively). In Equation\~\ref{eq:ficks}, $D_{a} = D(0)$ and $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}$ is the linear regression slope.

-   @tangContinuousMeasurementsSoil2005

This method assumes The advantage to this methodlinear regression assumes the co2 molar density and diffusivity increases linearly through the soil profile, so the computed surface flux is the extrapolated diffusivity times the slope of the linear regression of CO2 vs z. Tang et al 2005 computed the mean diffusivity between two different layers and then computed the gradient at each layer for a diffusive flux. This was then extrapolated to the surface concentration. These four methods were then implemented along with any uncertainty analysis (found via quadrature).

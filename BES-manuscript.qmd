# Introduction

Current estimates of the terrestrial carbon cycle indicate a net terrestrial carbon sink [@friedlingsteinGlobalCarbonBudget2023]. Accumulation of soil organic matter can be influenced by biotic factors from aboveground plant inputs [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017], which in turn are influenced through environmental factors such as growing season length, temperature, and moisture [@desaiDriversDecadalCarbon2022]. 

[[ NEED A BETTER TRANSITION SENTENCE ]] A soil carbon flux to the atmosphere ($F_{S}$, units $\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) represents the aggregate process of transfer of soil CO$_{2}$ to the atmosphere from physical and biological processes (e.g. diffusion and microbial and autotrophic respiration).  A soil carbon flux of carbon represents the complex interplay between aboveground feedbacks (e.g., gross primary productivity and its response to incoming radiation, temperature, and moisture) and belowground processes (feedback between soil microbial populations and physical transformations such as dissolution and chemical properties).


Soil carbon fluxes can be coupled with empirical or process models of soil carbon. Soil carbon fluxes can be assumed to represent soil carbon respiration from autotrophic or heterotrophic sources [@davidson_variability_2006], typically assumed to be static across the soil biome and modeled with a exponential $Q_{10}$ paradigm [@bond-lamberty_contribution_2004-1; @chen_does_2005; @hamdi_synthesis_2013].

Soil carbon fluxes also represent soil respiration
Measurement of $F_{S}$ is done through directly with soil chambers (e.g. LICOR or XXXX) or from soil measurements at different depths in the soil. In the latter case, the flux-gradient approach derives from the mass conservation from the vertical soil depth $z$ at steady state by applying Fick's law of diffusion. A simplifying assumption for the flux-gradient method is no mass transfer in the other spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$ [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014]. The diffusivity profile across the soil depth is a function of soil temperature, soil volumetric water content, atmospheric air pressure, and soil bulk density [@millingtonDiffusionAggregatedPorous1971; @moldrupModelingDiffusionReaction1999].


Currently we have the means to measure athe processes that regulate this tranformation from the soil - through systemative measurements of soil carbon content, soil CO2 at different depths, temperature, and soil moituere,, we can appl Fick's law to describe the surface soil flux through the flux gradient method.  Other measuremens exist such as measurement of soil fluxes directluy through the atmosphere using automated chamgers or smapling of soil flux measurement.

Although we have made progress in the htheoretical undertanding of soil fluxes, we have lgoiticalchalenges. any measuremrnt at depth requires distrubance of the soil, alhtogh passive nevironemtnal sensores repregents the nost cost effective way to do this.  The logistical challgnes oto automate and maintain these measurements also makes it difficult to work with.  The natioanl Ecolgoial Obsevantory Entowkr is a continental scale network wacross the United state st that currently provdies across 47 sites the challenges and meansurements needed to compute soil flux using hte flux graintent method. This produ was descoped at the time and currently is not computed.  Here we make use of this work to model soil carbon fluxes and to validate the measurements through an intensive field sampling campaign.

Key objectives of this study are to:
apply the flux-gradeint method to measuremtna dn maintain model fluxes
Benchmark produced soil carbon fluxes to other ancillary measusrements (SRDB, measurements of soil respiration)
Identify sources of error for future work.

MCA WORK------------
The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) presents a significant leap forward in the measurement of biogeochemical processes at the continental scale. Of particular importance is the nearly continuous measurement of belowground soil carbon processes, which is the largest aggregate reservoir of terrestrial carbon (Jobb√°gy & Jackson, 2000).  Techniques such as eddy covariance represent the cumulative sum of all ecosystem carbon fluxes in an airshed. At the same time, the data provided by NEON is on the same timescale as eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET, thus broadening the ability of researchers to quantify ecosystem fluxes in ever more diverse systems. Typically quantification of soil effluxes can also help constrain the magnitude of the other aboveground CO2 fluxes (Luo et al., 2011; Shao et al., 2013; Sihi et al., 2016; Todd-Brown et al., 2012). The "fusing" of eddy covariance data (from FLUXNET) with NEON data and models is one way to advance scientific understanding of carbon-cycle research and modeling in order to resolve the long-standing equifinality problem (Williams et al., 2009). 


All of these measurements are measured and available by NEON at the core terrestrial sites (see Figure 1).

# Materials and Methods
To compute a soil flux measurement, we acquired environmental observations and associated uncertainties from NEON servers using the `NEONUtilities` R package. Specific data products included half hourly soil water content, half-hourly soil CO$_{2}$, half-hourly atmospheric pressure, half-hourly soil temperature, and soil properties (e.g. bulk density). These static soil properties are periodically collected and assumed to be constant for the montly observation period. Each NEON observation site collects samples from three to five different spatial positions, with each position sampling at three to five different soil depths. 


The `neonSoilFlux` R package acquires the data for a given site and month and stacks observations into one nested list column for ease of computation, or alternatively, export measurements into a comma separate value file.  Quality flags are reported A measurement is Quality flags with an observation are reported as an indicator variable. If a given observation did is reported as not passing a quality assurance check we applied a gap filling method to replace that measurement with its monthly mean.

Following this initial data processing, temperature, soil water content were interpolated using splines to the same depth at CO$_{2}$ concentration measurements. CO$_{2}$ was converted to molar concentration ($\mu$mol m$^{-3}$).

## Computation of soil fluxes
For a given half hour, we applied Fick's law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}) to estimate the soil flux $F_{s}$, units $\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$:

\begin{equation}
F_{s} = -D_{a} \frac{dC}{dz},\label{eq:ficks}
\end{equation}

where $D_{a}$ is the diffusivity (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$). Computation of $D_{a}$ equals:

\begin{equation}
\xi D_{a,0}

\end{equation}The diffusion

We compute a site specific soil volume fraction ($f_{V}$, cm${^3}$ cm$^{-3}$) with particle densities of different size classes (less than 2 mm, 2-5 mm, and 5-20 mm). We assume the particle density of mineral soil ($\rho_{m}$) equals 2.65 g cm$^{-3}$.

$f_{rock} = \left(1- \frac{\rho_{Coarse}}{\rho_{m}} \right)\left(1-\frac{\rho_{2-5}}{\rho_{m}}+\frac{\rho_{5-20}}{\rho_{m}}\right)$

## Soil surface fluxes.

NEW WRITING
Using the three NEON measurements harmonized at a given depth along with an interpolated measurement of surface CO2 (through linear regression) soil fluxes were computed across each layer, according to the following convention:

We assume that the surface CO$_{2}$ flux density is a linear extrapolation of the remaining three layers [VERIFY THIS IS THE CASE].  Once this is computed we then are ready to compute the surface flux.

A soil flux measurement is reported as $F_{ijk}$, with i, j, k being 0 or 1.  The flux across a surface $F_{100}$, $F_{010}$, $F_{001}$ refer to a single soil flux across a layer.

A computation of a surface flux is linear extrapolation of the flux measurements indexed, so then $F_{101}$ is a linear extrapolation of $F_{100}$ and $F_{001}$. Any uncertainties are reported through with quadrature.  The computation of the surface flux using this method allows for the selection and investigation of different assumptions of how fluxes are computed (cite references) with a unified framework. 

Soil fluxes were computed across three different layers in the soil according to NEON measurements (see conceptual diagram)



END NEW WRITING


We computed the soil surface flux (Equation~\ref{eq:ficks}) with four different approaches [@maierUsingGradientMethod2014], outlined below. Surface fluxes were computed from the three CO$_{2}$ concentration measurement levels closest to the soil surface. Spline fits were used to infer soil temperature and soil moisture at the same measurement levels as CO$_{2}$ concentration and used to compute diffusivity at these depths. We applied quadrature to compute uncertainty at each calculation in computing diffusivity $D_{a}$ or the surface gradient $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}$.

Methodological differences are in the estimation of either the surface gradient $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}These approaches differ in terms of how the Four different approaches were used in the flux gradient method, based on a review from Maier Schack Kirchner.
De Jong and Schappert (1972) computes a linear regression of CO2 molar concentration at depth. Once that is computed, the surface gradient is then approximated by F = -D1 * (C0 - C1)/(0-z1), where (z1,C1) is the measurement depth closest to the surface. The The flux is estimated by does a linear regression for the C(z) and then uses C0 
Hirano et al (2005) also takes the linear regression to create a new vector and the center between each measurement depth C = (C0, Ci) and z = (0, zi) and then estimates the gradient at each depth. (dC/dz)_i.  A flux at each depth is computed to then extrapolate the surface concentration. [[ FILL IN MORE HERE ]]

We partition the soil into three distinct layers. Assuming that the soil profile is non-uniform, we use In computing the diffusivity to account for variation across layers (i.e. ), we use the weighted harmonic mean [@turcuContinuousSoilCarbon2005]:

\begin{equation}
D_{a;i,i+1}=\frac{z_{i+1}-z_{i}}{\frac{}}
\end{equation}


- @tangAssessingSoilCO22003 assumes that both CO$_{2}$ molar density and diffusivity increases linearly through the soil profile ($C(z)$ and $D(z)$ respectively). In Equation~\ref{eq:ficks}, $D_{a} = D(0)$ and $\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}$ is the linear regression slope.

- @tangContinuousMeasurementsSoil2005


This method assumes  The advantage to this methodlinear regression assumes the co2 molar density and diffusivity increases linearly through the soil profile, so the computed surface flux is the extrapolated diffusivity times the slope of the linear regression of CO2 vs z.
Tang et al 2005 computed the mean diffusivity between two different layers and then computed the gradient at each layer for a diffusive flux.  This was then extrapolated to the surface concentration.
These four methods were then implemented along with any uncertainty analysis (found via quadrature).




Error handling
We use the fact that reported error measurements occur at a given sampling location i and depth j.  NEON reports QF flags as a binary value.  Since we want the QF for a given flux measurement to represent 0 if no measurements across depths were fine, and 1 if either a smoothed mean was used for a given depth. We assign an aggregate QF value for a given time.

Gap filling module
To compute the monthly mean we used a bootstrapped sample of measurements from the reported measurements which passed the QC and the uncertainty by bootstrapping. We assume that the measurement comes from a normally distributed distribution with mean and standard deviation. A given number of bootstrap samples are specified so that new replicate samples are created, then the mean is taken.  a measurement a specified number of times [LINK] with x + epsilon 
Assume there is a vector of means x, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval of the uncertainty. The bias in a measurement is given by the difference between the 95% confidence interval and the standard deviation in quadrature standard deviation and For a specified number of bootstrap samples.

The monthly mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is computed through bootstrapping from the available measurements that We apply a bootstrap sample for the distribution of the monthly mean measurements, and generate a sampling distribution of both the monthly mean ($\overline{\mathbf{x}}$) and standard deviation ($\mathbf{s}$) the following ways.



repeatedly sample from this bootstrap 

We compute a monthly mean at a location's spatial depth $z$ with at least 15 measurements without any quality control issues. These measurements are represented by the vector $\mathbf{m}$, standard errors $\boldsymbol\sigma$, and the 95% confidence interval (the so-called expanded uncertainty, @farranceUncertaintyMeasurementReview2012) $\boldsymbol\epsilon$. All of these vectors have length $M$. We have that $\vec{\sigma}_{i}\leq\vec{\epsilon}_{i}$.  We define the bias as $\mathbf{b}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol\epsilon^{2}-\boldsymbol\sigma^{2}}$.


We generate a vector of bootstrap samples of the distribution  of the monthly mean $\overline{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and monthly standard error $\overline{\boldsymbol\sigma}$ the following ways. Here we set the number of bootstrap samples $B$ to be 5000. Entries for both are determined by the following:

1. Randomly sample from the uncertainty and bias independently: $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$ and the bias $\mathbf{b}_{k}$ (not necessarily the same sample)
2. Generate a vector $\mathbf{n}$ of length $N$, where $\mathbf{n}_{i}$ is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{m}_{i}$ and standard deviation $\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}$. Since $M<N$, values from $\mathbf{m}$ will be reused.
3. With these $N$ random samples, $\overline{y}_{i}=\overline{\vec{x}}+\vec{b}_{k}$ and $s_{i}$ is the sample standard deviation of $\vec{x}$. We expect that $s_{i} \approx \vec{\sigma}_{j}$.

Once that is complete, the reported monthly mean and standard deviation is $\overline{\overline{y}}$ and $\overline{s}$.

The surface flux is all possible combinations of $F_{ijk}$ extrapolating the flux measurements to the surface, so $F_{110}$ is the surface flux intercept linearly extrapolating the measurements $F_{010}$ and $F_{100}$.

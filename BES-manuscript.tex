\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Accurate quantification of soil carbon fluxes is essential to reduce
uncertainty in estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink. However, these
fluxes vary over time and across ecosystem types and so it can be
difficult to estimate them accurately across large scales. The flux
gradient method estimates soil carbon fluxes using co-located
measurements of soil CO\(_{2}\) concentration, soil temperature, soil
moisture, and other soil properties. The National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON) provides such data across 20 ecoclimatic domains spanning
the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawai`i. We present an R
software package (\texttt{neonSoilFlux}) that acquires soil
environmental data to compute half-hourly soil carbon fluxes for each
soil replicate plot at a given terrestrial NEON site. To assess the
computed fluxes, we visited six focal NEON sites and measured soil
carbon fluxes using a closed-dynamic chamber approach. Outputs from the
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} showed agreement with measured fluxes (\(R^{2}\)
between measured and \texttt{neonSoilFlux} outputs ranging from 0.04 to
0.81 depending on calculation method used); measured outputs generally
fell within the range of calculated uncertainties from the gradient
method. Calculated fluxes from \texttt{neonSoilFlux} aggregated to the
daily scale exhibited expected site-specific seasonal patterns. While
the flux gradient method is broadly effective, its accuracy is highly
sensitive to site-specific inputs, including the extent to which
gap-filing techniques are used to interpolate missing sensor data and to
estimates of soil diffusivity and moisture content. Future refinement
and validation of \texttt{neonSoilFlux} outputs can contribute to
existing databases of soil carbon flux measurements, providing near
real-time estimates of a critical component of the terrestrial carbon
cycle.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Soils contain the planet's largest reservoir of terrestrial carbon
(JobbÃ¡gy \& Jackson, 2000). A critical component of this reservoir is
soil organic matter, the accumulation of which is influenced by biotic
factors such as above-ground plant inputs (Jackson et al., 2017). These
inputs in turn are influenced by environmental factors such as growing
season length, temperature, and moisture (Desai et al., 2022), which
also affect the breakdown of soil organic matter and its return to the
atmosphere. Across heterogeneous terrestrial landscapes, the interplay
between these biotic and abiotic factors influence the size of the soil
contribution to the terrestrial carbon sink (Friedlingstein et al.,
2025). However, the heterogeneity of these processes across diverse
ecosystems in the context of rapid environmental change leads to large
uncertainty about the magnitude of this sink in the future, and thus
there remains a pressing need to quantify changes in soil carbon pools
and fluxes across scales.

Ecological observation networks such as the United States' National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and others (e.g.~the
globally-distributed FLUXNET or the European Integrated Carbon
Observation System) present a significant advancement in the nearly
continuous observation of biogeochemical processes at the continental
scale. Notably, at 47 terrestrial sites across the continental United
States that span 20 ecoclimatic domains, NEON provides half-hourly
measurements of soil CO\(_{2}\) concentration, temperature, and moisture
at different vertical depths. Each of these NEON sites also encompasses
measurements of the cumulative sum of all ecosystem carbon fluxes in an
airshed using the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi, 2014). Soil
observations provided by NEON are on the same timescale and standardized
with eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET. These types of nearly
continuous observational data (NEON and FLUXNET) can be used to
reconcile differences between model-derived or data-estimated components
of ecosystem carbon flux (Jian et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2011; Phillips
et al., 2017; J. Shao et al., 2015; P. Shao et al., 2013; Sihi et al.,
2016).

Estimated or observed soil carbon fluxes are a key metric for
understanding change in soil carbon pools over time (Bond-Lamberty et
al., 2024). A soil carbon flux to the atmosphere (\(F_{S}\), units
\(\mu\)mol m\(^{-2}\) s\(^{-1}\)), represents the aggregate process of
transfer of soil CO\(_{2}\) to the atmosphere from physical and
biological processes (e.g.~diffusion and respiration). Soil carbon
fluxes can be assumed to encompass soil carbon respiration from
autotrophic or heterotrophic sources (Davidson et al., 2006) and modeled
with a exponential \(Q_{10}\) paradigm (Bond-Lamberty et al., 2004; Chen
\& Tian, 2005; Hamdi et al., 2013).

One common method by which \(F_{S}\) is measured in the field is through
the use of soil chambers in a closed, well-mixed system (Norman et al.,
1997) with headspace trace gas concentrations measured with an infrared
gas analyzer (IRGA). \(F_{S}\) can also be estimated from soil
CO\(_{2}\) measurements at different depths in the soil using the
flux-gradient method (Maier \& Schack-Kirchner, 2014). Closed-chamber
IRGA measurements, while being the most common method, require either
frequent in-person site visits or expensive and fragile automated
systems. The potential of the gradient method is that fluxes can be
estimated from continuous data recorded by robust solid-state sensors.
The flux-gradient method is an approach that uses conservation of mass
to calculate flux at a vertical soil depth \(z\) at steady state by
applying Fick's law of diffusion. A simplifying assumption for the
flux-gradient method is that there is no mass transfer in the other
spatial dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) (Maier \& Schack-Kirchner, 2014). The
diffusivity profile, a key component of this calculation, varies across
the soil depth as a function of soil temperature, soil volumetric water
content, atmospheric air pressure, and soil bulk density (Millington \&
Shearer, 1971; Moldrup et al., 1999; Sallam et al., 1984).

Databases such as the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) or the Continuous
Soil Respiration Database (COSORE) add to the growing network of
resources for making collected observations of soil fluxes available to
other researchers (Bond-Lamberty, 2018; Bond-Lamberty et al., 2020;
Bond-Lamberty \& Thomson, 2010; Jian et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2024).
However, these databases currently encompass primarily direct soil
measurements of fluxes (i.e.~those using methods like the closed-chamber
method described above). Currently, NEON provides all measurements to
calculate \(F_{S}\) from Fick's law, but soil flux as a derived data
product was descoped from the initial network launch due to budget
constraints (Berenbaum et al., 2015). Deriving estimates of \(F_{S}\)
using continuous sensor data across NEON sites thus remains a high
priority.

This study describes an R software package, \texttt{neonSoilFlux}, that
computes a standardized estimate of \(F_{S}\) at all terrestrial NEON
sites using the flux-gradient method. Using direct chamber-based field
observations of soil carbon dioxide flux from a subset of terrestrial
NEON sites spanning six states, we provide a direct validation of
\(F_{S}\) from \texttt{neonSoilFlux}.

Key objectives of this study are to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Apply the flux-gradient method to estimate soil CO\(_{2}\) flux from
  continuous sensor measurements across six NEON sites.
\item
  Benchmark estimated soil carbon fluxes against field measurements
  (e.g.~direct chamber measurements of soil flux).
\item
  Identify sources of error in the flux-gradient approach across diverse
  sites in order to guide future work.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-and-methods}

\subsection{Field methods}\label{field-methods}

\subsubsection{Focal NEON Sites}\label{focal-neon-sites}

In order to acquire field data to validate model predictions of flux, we
selected six terrestrial NEON sites for analysis. We conducted roughly
week-long field measurement campaigns at these sites, which span a range
of environmental gradients and terrestrial domains
(Table~\ref{tbl-neon-sites}). SJER, SRER, and WREF were visited during
May and June of 2022, and WOOD, KONZ, and UNDE during May and June of
2024.

\subsubsection{Soil collar placement}\label{soil-collar-placement}

Either one (2022 sampling campaign) or two (2024 sampling campaign) PVC
soil collars (20.1 cm inside diameter) were installed in close proximity
to the permanent NEON soil sensors at each site
(Figure~\ref{fig-collar-images}). As instruments in the NEON soil sensor
arrays can occasionally break down or stop working, the specific soil
plot where we made measurements was chosen at each site in consultation
with NEON staff to maximize likelihood of quality soil sensor
measurements during the duration of the IRGA measurements. The plot
selected at each site (out of the 5 in each replicate array at each
site) are presented in the last column of Table~\ref{tbl-neon-sites}.
After installation, collar(s) were left to equilibrate for approximately
24 hours prior to any measurements being taken.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Infrared gas analyzer measurements of
soil CO\(_{2}\)
flux}{Infrared gas analyzer measurements of soil CO\_\{2\} flux}}\label{infrared-gas-analyzer-measurements-of-soil-co_2-flux}

In 2022, we then made measurements of flux on an hourly interval for 8
hours each day. Measurements were taken from roughly 8 am to 4 pm, with
the time interval selected to capture the majority of the diurnal
gradient of soil temperature each day. These measurements were made
using a LI-6800 infrared gas analyzer instrument (LI-COR Environmental,
Lincoln, NE) fitted with a soil chamber attachment (attachment 6800-09).
In 2024, we again used the same LI-6800 instrument, but made half-hourly
measurements over an approximately 8 hour period. In addition, in 2024
we also installed a second collar and used a second instrument, an
LI-870 CO\(_{2}\) IRGA, connected to an automated robotic chamber
(LI-COR chamber 8200-104) controlled by an LI-8250 multiplexer to make
automated measurements. The multiplexer was configured to take
half-hourly measurements 24 hours a day for the duration of our sampling
bout at each site. Each instrument was paired with a soil temperature
and moisture probe (Stevens HydraProbe, Stevens Water, Portland, OR)
that was used to make soil temperature and moisture measurements
concurrent with the CO\(_{2}\) flux measurements. Chamber volumes were
set by measuring collar offsets at each site. System checks were
conducted daily for the LI-6800 and weekly for the LI-8250. Instruments
were factory calibrated before each field season.

\subsubsection{Post-collection processing of field
data}\label{post-collection-processing-of-field-data}

We used LI-COR SoilFluxPro software (v 5.3.1) to assess the data after
collection and to inform sampling parameters. We checked appropriateness
of dead band and measurement durations using built-in evaluation tools.
Based on this, the deadband period was set for 30-40 seconds, depending
on the site, and the measurement duration was 180 seconds with a 30
second pre-purge and a 30 second post-purge at most sites, and a 90
second pre- and post-purge at sites with higher humidity due to recent
precipitation events. We also assessed the \(R^{2}\) of linear and
exponential model fits to measured CO\(_{2}\) to verify measurement
quality.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{neonSoilFlux} R
package}{neonSoilFlux R package}}\label{sec-nsf-desc}

We developed an R package called \texttt{neonSoilFlux} (Zobitz et al.,
2024) to compute half-hourly soil carbon fluxes and uncertainties from
NEON data. The objective of the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package is a
unified workflow (Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram}) for soil data
acquisition and analysis that supplements the existing
\texttt{neonUtilities} data acquisition R package (Lunch et al., 2025).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{figures/neonSoilFluxOutline.png}

\caption{\label{fig-package-diagram}Diagram of \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R
package. For a given month, year, and NEON site (orange parallelogram),
the package acquires all relevant data to compute \(F_{S}\) using the
\texttt{neonUtilities} R package (green rectangle). Data are gap-filled
according to reported QA flags and adjusted for changes in soil water
content (SWC) calibration coefficients, then interpolated to the same
measurement depth before computing the soil flux, uncertainties, and
final QA flags (blue rectangles). The package reports the associated
soil flux, uncertainties, and quality assurance (QA) flags for the user
(purple parallelogram).}

\end{figure}%

At a given NEON site there are five replicate soil plots, each with
measurements of soil CO\(_{2}\) concentration, soil temperature, and
soil moisture at different depths (Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}). The
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} package acquires measured soil CO\(_{2}\)
concentration (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024b),
soil temperature (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON),
2024d), soil water content (National Ecological Observatory Network
(NEON), 2024e), barometric pressure from the nearby tower (National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024a), and soil properties
(e.g.~bulk density) (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON),
2024c) from a range of different NEON data products. The static soil
properties were collected by NEON staff from a nearby soil pit during
initial site characterization and are assumed to be constant at each
site. A soil flux calculation is computed at each replicate soil plot.

\caption{\label{fig-model-diagram}Model diagram of the data workflow for
the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R package. a) Acquire: Data are obtained for a
given NEON location and horizontal sensor location, which includes soil
water content, soil temperature, CO\(_{2}\) concentration, and
atmospheric pressure. All data are screened for quality assurance; if
gap-filling of missing data occurs, it is flagged for the user. b)
Harmonize: Any belowground data are then harmonized to the same depth as
CO\(_{2}\) concentrations using linear regression. c) Compute: The flux
across a given depth is computed via Fick's law, denoted with
\(F_{ijk}\), where \(i\), \(j\), or \(k\) are either 0 or 1 denoting the
layers the flux is computed across (\(i\) = closest to surface, \(k\) =
deepest). \(F_{000}\) represents a flux estimate where the gradient
\(dC/dz\) is the slope of a linear regression of CO\(_{2}\) with depth.}

\end{figure}%

The workflow to compute a value of \(F_{S}\) with \texttt{neonSoilFlux}
consists of three primary steps, illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}. First, NEON data are acquired for a
given site and month via the \texttt{neonUtilities} R package (yellow
parallelogram and green rectangle in Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram}
and Panel a in Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}). Acquired environmental
data can be exported to a comma separated value file for additional
analysis. Quality assurance (QA) flags are reported as an indicator
variable. Since the calibration coefficients on the soil water content
sensors have changed over time (National Ecological Observatory Network
(NEON), 2024e), raw sensor measurements were back-calculated and
soil-specific calibrations were applied following Ayres et al. (2024) to
generate a consistent time series at each measurement location.

The second step is harmonizing the data to compute soil fluxes across
soil layers. This step consists of three different actions (blue
rectangles in Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram} and Panel b in
Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}). If a given observation by NEON is
reported as not passing a quality assurance check, we applied a gap
filling method to replace that measurement with its monthly mean at that
same depth (Section~\ref{sec-gapfilling}). Belowground measurements of
soil water and soil temperature are then interpolated to the same depth
as soil CO\(_{2}\) measurements. The diffusivity
(Section~\ref{sec-compute-diffusivity}) and soil flux across different
soil layers (Section~\ref{sec-compute-soil-flux}) are then computed.

The third and final step is computing a surface soil flux through
extrapolation to the surface (purple parallelogram in
Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram} and Panel c in
Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}). Uncertainty on a soil flux measurement
is computed through quadrature. An aggregate quality assurance (QA) flag
for each environmental measurement is also reported, representing if any
gap-filled measurements were used in the computation of a soil flux.
Within the soil flux-gradient method, several different approaches can
be used to derive a surface flux (Maier \& Schack-Kirchner, 2014); the
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} package reports four different possible values for
soil surface flux (Section~\ref{sec-compute-soil-flux}) for each of two
different methods of diffusivity estimation, for a total of eight
estimates of flux.

\subsubsection{Gap-filling routine}\label{sec-gapfilling}

NEON reports QA flags as binary values for each measurement and
half-hourly interval. For a given half-hour, if any input variable (soil
CO\(_2\) concentration, soil temperature, or soil moisture) at depth
\(z\) is flagged, computation of \(F_S\) is not possible. To address
this, flagged measurements and their uncertainties were replaced with a
bootstrapped monthly mean (\(\overline{m}\)) and monthly standard
deviation (\(\overline{s}\)) (Efron \& Tibshirani, 1994).

For each month, depth \(z\), and variable, we computed bootstrapped
estimates of \(\overline{m}\) and \(\overline{s}\) from the vectors of
unflagged measurements (\(\mathbf{m}\)), reported standard errors
(\(\boldsymbol\sigma\)), and the 95\% confidence interval
(\(\boldsymbol\epsilon\), or expanded uncertainty; Farrance \& Frenkel
(2012)). We also defined a bias vector
\(\mathbf{b}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol\epsilon^{2}-\boldsymbol\sigma^{2}}\),
which quantifies the spread of uncertainty in a given period and is
incorporated into \(\overline{m}\).

From these, 5000 bootstrap samples were generated for
\(\mathbf{m}, \boldsymbol\sigma\), and \(\mathbf{b}\). For each sample
(\(m_k, b_k, \sigma_k\)), we generated a vector \(\mathbf{n}\) (length
\(N=5000\)) by drawing from a normal distribution with mean \(m_k+b_k\)
and standard deviation \(\sigma_k\). The sample mean and standard
deviation were then computed from \(\mathbf{n}\). The resulting
distributions of sample means and sample standard deviations provided
the bootstrapped monthly mean (\(\overline{m}\)) and standard error
(\(\overline{s}\)) respectively.

This gap-filling procedure provides a consistent treatment across all
data streams. However, alternative approaches may be better suited for
longer gaps (e.g., correlations with other NEON measurement levels or
soil plots) or for variable-specific conditions. We discuss the effect
of gap-filling on our results in Section~\ref{sec-general-eval}.

\subsubsection{Soil diffusivity}\label{sec-compute-diffusivity}

Soil diffusivity \(D_{a}\) at a given measurement depth is the product
of the diffusivity in free air \(D_{a,0}\) (m\(^{2}\) s\(^{-1}\)) and
the tortuosity \(\xi\) (no units) (Millington \& Shearer, 1971).

We compute \(D_{a,0}\) with Equation \ref{eq:da0}:

\begin{equation}
  D_{a,0} = 0.0000147 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{i} + 273.15}{293.15} \right)^{1.75} \cdot \left( \frac{P}{101.3} \right)
  \label{eq:da0}
\end{equation}

where \(T_{i}\) is soil temperature (\(^\circ\)C) at depth \(i\)
(National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024d) and \(P\)
surface barometric pressure (kPa) (National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON), 2024a).

Previous studies by Sallam et al. (1984) and Tang et al. (2003)
demonstrated the sensitivity of modeled \(F_{S}\) depending on the
tortuosity model (\(\xi\)) used to compute diffusivity. At low soil
water content, the choice of tortuosity model can lead to
order-of-magnitude differences in \(D_{a}\), which in turn affect
modeled \(F_{S}\). The \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package currently includes
two approaches to calculate \(\xi\), representing the range of
tortuosity behavior reported in Sallam et al. (1984).

The first approach is the Millington-Quirk model (Millington \& Shearer,
1971), in which tortuosity depends on both porosity and soil water
content:

\begin{equation}
  \xi = \frac{(\phi - SWC_{i})^{10/3}}{\phi^{2}}
  \label{eq:tortuosity-mq}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{eq:tortuosity-mq}, \(SWC\) is the soil water content at
depth \(i\) (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024e) and
\(\phi\) is the porosity, which in turn is a function of soil physical
properties (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024c):

\begin{equation}
  \phi = \left(1- \frac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{m}} \right) \left(1-f_{V}\right)
  \label{eq:porosity}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{eq:porosity}, \(\rho_{m}\) is the particle density of
mineral soil (2.65 g cm\(^{-3}\)), \(\rho_{s}\) the soil bulk density (g
cm\(^{-3}\)) excluding coarse fragments greater than 2 mm (National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024c), and \(f_{V}\) is a
site-specific value that accounts for the proportion of soil fragments
between 2-20 mm. Soil fragments greater than 20 mm were not estimated
due to limitations in the amount of soil that can be analyzed (National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024c). We assume that rock
fragments contain no internal pores.

The Millington-Quirk model assumes \(\xi\) is modulated by the amount of
fluid saturation in soil pores (Millington \& Shearer, 1971). In
contrast, the Marshall model (Marshall, 1959) expresses tortuosity as
only a function of porosity (\(\xi = \phi^{1.5}\)), with \(\phi\)
defined from Equation \ref{eq:porosity}. The Marshall model is
independent of soil water content and assumes tortuosity is only
governed by soil structure. The \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package allows
users to choose the tortuosity model most appropriate for site-specific
conditions and research goals.

\subsubsection{Soil flux computation}\label{sec-compute-soil-flux}

We applied Fick's law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}) to compute the soil flux
\(F_{ij}\) (\(\mu\)mol m\(^{-2}\) s\(^{-1}\)) across two soil depths
\(i\) and \(j\):

\begin{equation}
  F_{ij} = -D_{a} \frac{dC}{dz}
  \label{eq:ficks}
\end{equation}

where \(D_{a}\) is the diffusivity (m\(^{2}\) s\(^{-1}\)) and
\(\frac{dC}{dz}\) is the gradient of CO\(_{2}\) molar concentration
(\(\mu\)mol m\(^{-3}\), so the gradient has units of \(\mu\)mol
m\(^{-3}\) m\(^{-1}\)). The soil surface flux is theoretically defined
by applying Equation \ref{eq:ficks} to measurements collected at the
soil surface and directly below the surface. Measurements of soil
temperature, soil water content, and soil CO\(_{2}\) molar concentration
across the soil profile allow for application of Equation \ref{eq:ficks}
across different soil depths. Each site had three measurement layers, so
we denote the flux as a three-digit subscript \(F_{ijk}\) with indicator
variables \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) indicate if a given layer was used
(written in order of increasing depth), according to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(F_{000}\) is a surface flux estimate using the intercept of the
  linear regression of \(D_{a}\) with depth and the slope from the
  linear regression of CO\(_{2}\) with depth (which represents
  \(\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}\) in Fick's Law). Tang et al. (2003)
  used this approach to compute fluxes in an oak-grass savannah.
\item
  \(F_{110}\) is a flux estimate across the two shallowest measurement
  layers.
\item
  \(F_{011}\) is a flux estimate across the two deepest measurement
  layers.
\item
  \(F_{101}\) is a flux estimate across the shallowest and deepest
  measurement layers.
\end{itemize}

For \(F_{110}\), \(F_{011}\), and \(F_{101}\), the diffusivity used in
Fick's Law is always at the deeper measurement layer. When used as a
surface flux estimate we assume CO\(_{2}\) remains constant above this
flux depth. Uncertainty in all \(F_{ijk}\) values was quantified using
quadrature (Taylor, 2022). These computed fluxes could provide the basis
for additional soil flux estimates. For example, Tang et al. (2005)
estimated surface flux by linearly extrapolating \(F_{110}\) and
\(F_{011}\) to the soil surface.

\subsection{Post processing evaluation}\label{sec-post-process}

Following collection of field measurements and calculation of the soil
fluxes from \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package, we compared measured
\(F_{S}\) based on closed-dynamic chamber measurements with the LI-COR
instruments to a given soil flux calculation from \texttt{neonSoilFlux}
for each site and flux computation method and quantified the
relationship statistically (R\(^{2}\)). Finally, for a half-hourly
interval we also computed a \emph{post hoc} diffusivity (\(D_{a}\))
using the LI-COR flux along with the CO\(_{2}\) surface gradient
reported by NEON using the measurement levels closest to the surface.

The timeseries of the measured fluxes from the LI-COR 6800 and 870/8250
were compared to modeled soil fluxes from the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R
package (Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results}). We also assessed year-long
estimated flux time series and compared those to field measurements made
at each site (Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results-year}). Results are reported
in local time. Where applicable, sites are displayed from left to right
by increasing soil temperature (Table~\ref{tbl-neon-sites}). Positive
values of the flux indicate that there is a flux moving towards the
surface. Overall, with the exception of SRER (discussed later) the
computed fluxes determined using a variety of plausible methods spanned
the field-measured fluxes, but the specific flux-gradient method that
best approximated field measurements varied by site.

In four of six field sites, the \emph{post hoc} \(D_{a}\) estimate fell
roughly between the two diffusion estimation methods; however this was
less the case in the two driest sites, SJER and SRER

was either lower or higher than both of the other methods
(Figure~\ref{fig-diffusivity-plot}).

\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}

This study presents a unified data science workflow to efficiently
process automated measurements of belowground soil CO\(_{2}\)
concentrations, soil water content, and soil temperature to infer
estimates of soil surface CO\(_{2}\) effluxes through application of
Fick's Law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}). Our core goals in this study were:
(1) to generate estimates of soil flux from continuous soil sensor data
at terrestrial NEON sites using the flux-gradient method and then (2) to
compare those estimates to field-measured fluxes based on the closed
chamber approach at six NEON focal sites. We discuss our progress toward
these core goals through (1) an overall evaluation of the flux-gradient
approach (and uncertainty calculation) and (2) site-specific evaluation
of differences in estimated vs measured fluxes.

\subsection{General evaluation of flux-gradient
approach}\label{sec-general-eval}

Key assumptions of the flux-gradient approach are that CO\(_{2}\)
concentrations increase throughout the soil profile such that the
highest concentrations are observed in the deepest layers. Additionally,
field flux measurements should correlate with \(F_{000}\) because they
represent surface fluxes. Periods where this gradient condition are not
met generally are connected to processes that occur during soil wetting
events, where more shallow soil layers produce higher concentrations of
CO\(_{2}\) due to microbial respiration pulses following rewetting. This
effect is likely to be largest at sites with rich organic soils
(e.g.~KONZ). Based on this reasoning, in these types of situations we
would \emph{a priori} expect
\(F_{011} \mbox{ (deepest layers) } \leq F_{101} \leq F_{110} \mbox{ (shallow layers) } \leq F_{000} \mbox{ (all layers) }\)
because the previous flux estimates rely primarily on CO\(_2\)
concentrations at deeper depths, and could miss high concentrations of
CO\(_{2}\) produced in shallower layers.

When modeling soil respiration, typically a non-linear response function
that also considers soil type is used (Bouma \& Bryla, 2000; Yan et al.,
2016, 2018). For the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package, soil type is
connected to the measurement of bulk density, which was characterized at
each NEON site. This bulk density estimate is based on replicate samples
collected from the site megapit at a subset of soil horizons, with an
estimated uncertainty of \(\pm5\%\) (National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON), 2024c). Coarse fragment estimates also have very large
uncertainties, but because the volume fraction tends to be low in
surface soils it is unlikely to contribute much additional flux
uncertainty.

Our results suggest that the most important way to improve reliability
of the flux estimate is to reduce the usage of gap-filled data. The
current approach to gap filling in \texttt{neonSoilFlux} uses monthly
mean data to gap fill---this approach decreases the ability of the
estimate to be responsive to short-term pulses that occur with rapid
weather shifts. Four sites (KONZ, SRER, WREF, and UNDE) had more than
75\% of half-hourly periods with no-gap filled measurements (Figure S1,
Supplementary Information). Two sites (SJER and WOOD) had more than 75\%
of half-hourly intervals with just one gap-filled measurement. The large
uncertainty evident in Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results} for estimates from
WOOD and SJER are thus due in part to the gap-filling used in these
sites (Figure S1). While we did not need to use gap-filled measurements
to compute the flux at WREF, field data collection occurred following a
severe rainstorm, with soils at the beginning of the sampling week near
their water holding capacity. In general, we recommend that whenever
possible, knowledge of local field conditions should influence analysis
decisions in addition to any QA filtering protocols in the
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} package.

We recognize that this gap-filling approach may lead to gap-filled
values that are quite different from the actual values, such as an
underestimate of soil moisture following rain events. Further extensions
of the gap filling method could use more sophisticated gap-filling
routines, similar to what is used for net ecosystem carbon exchange
(Falge et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2023; Mariethoz et al., 2015; Moffat et
al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, since the deepest
temperature and soil moisture sensors are located below the deepest
CO\textsubscript{2} sensors at NEON sites, it is possible that excluding
these deeper layers from consideration prior to analysis would lead to a
reduced need for gap filling. Future iterations of the
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} package may incorporate this as an option. The
current gap-filling routine provides a consistent approach that can be
applied to each data stream, but further work may explore alternative
gap-filling approaches.

\subsection{Evaluation of flux-gradient approach at each
site}\label{evaluation-of-flux-gradient-approach-at-each-site}

Derived results from the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package have patterns
that are broadly consistent with those directly measured in the field
(Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results} and Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results-year}),
even though statistical comparisons between the field-measured and
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} values were quite variable (e.g.~\(R^{2}\) ranging
from 0.04 to 0.81; Figure~\ref{fig-r2-plot}). One advantage of the
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} package is its ability to calculate fluxes across
different soil depths (Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}), which allows for
additional site-specific customization. We believe the package can
provide a useful baseline estimate of soil fluxes that can always be
complemented through additional field measurements.

The six locations studied provide a range of case studies that suggest
different considerations may apply to different sites when applying the
flux-gradient method. For example, the Santa Rita Experimental Range
(SRER) is a desert site characterized by sandy soil, which also was the
location of the highest field soil temperatures that we observed
(Table~\ref{tbl-licor-results}). At SRER the flux across the top two
layers (\(F_{110}\)) produced a pattern of soil flux most consistent
with the observed field data. The remaining methods \(F_{101}\),
\(F_{011}\), or \(F_{000}\) are derived from information taken from the
deepest layer, which seems to have been decoupled from the surface
layers both in terms of temperature and CO\(_{2}\) concentration. This
may be a general circumstance where there are large diurnal temperature
extremes that rapidly change during the course of a day and overnight,
leading to lags in the timing of when temperature increases propagate
down to deeper soil layers.

Immediately prior to our visit to Konza Prarie (KONZ), that site that
experienced a significant rain event that led to wet soils that
gradually dried out over the course of our time there. This pulse of
precipitation increased the soil CO\(_{2}\) concentration at the top
layer above the concentrations in lower layers, leading to negative
estimated flux values at the start of the field sampling period. In this
case it was only when the soil began to return to a baseline level that
the assumptions of the flux-gradient method were again met.

Both of the previous cases also provide context for the variable
statistical comparisons between field-measured soil fluxes and
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} outputs (Figure~\ref{fig-r2-plot}). When
considering systematic deployment of this method across a measurement
network, there are a number of independent challenges that require
careful consideration. There are clear tradeoffs between (1) accuracy of
modeled fluxes (defined here as closeness to field-measured \(F_{S}\)
and the uncertainty reduction factor \(\epsilon\)), (2) precision (which
could be defined by the signal to noise ratio), and (3) the choice of
the diffusivity model (Section~\ref{sec-compute-diffusivity}) or flux
computation method (Section~\ref{sec-compute-soil-flux}). A sensitivity
analysis (Figure S2, Supplemental Information) found that flux output
uncertainty was dominated by measurement uncertainty (\(T_{S}\), \(P\),
\(SWC\), or CO\(_{2}\)) rather than by the diffusivity method used to
compute soil flux. Notably, the \(F_{110}\) method was least sensitive
to measurement uncertainty likely because it best aligns with the
surface chamber measurement assumptions.

Finally, comparing the effects of different diffusivity estimation
methods on the match between modeled and measured fluxes
(Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results-year}) highlights the sensitivity of
\(F_{ijk}\) to diffusivity. The comparison between diffusivity estimates
compared to field estimated diffusivity
(Figure~\ref{fig-diffusivity-plot}) demonstrates that site parameters
can dictate which measure of diffusivity is most likely to be accurate
in a given environmental context. Site-specific differences are largely
a reflection of differences in soil moisture across the sites
(Table~\ref{tbl-neon-sites}), as not all diffusivity estimation methods
incorporate soil moisture equivalently. While we here have compares two
approaches to calculate diffusivity (the Millington-Quirk and Marshall
models), it may be valuable to evaluate other diffusivity models
(e.g.~the Moldrup model; Moldrup et al. (1999)) as well. Ultimately the
choice of a particular diffusivity model could be determined based on
knowledge of site-specific evaluations or a set of these models could be
used to generate a model ensemble average as a means to trade precision
for a more general approach.

\subsection{Recommendations for future method
development}\label{recommendations-for-future-method-development}

The \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package provides several approaches to
estimate soil flux using the gradient method. We believe these
approaches enable the software to be used across a range of
site-specific assumptions (Maier \& Schack-Kirchner, 2014). We note,
however, that this choice can have a determinative approach on the
calculated values. Ensemble averaging approaches (Elshall et al., 2018;
Raftery et al., 2005) may be one way to address this problem if the goal
is to calculate fluxes using the same method at a diverse range of
different sites. Two other ideas would be to apply machine learning
algorithms (e.g.~random forest) to generate a single flux estimate
across diverse sites, or using co-located estimates of net ecosystem
carbon exchange from eddy-flux towers to further constrain results or to
assess soil flux results for plausibility (Phillips et al., 2017).

These challenges notwithstanding, the method used here and made
available in the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R package has the potential to
produce nearly continuous estimates of flux across all terrestrial NEON
sites. These estimates are a significant improvement on available
approaches to constrain the portion of ecosystem respiration
attributable to the soil. This, in turn, also aids in our ability to
understand the soil contribution to the net ecosystem flux measured at
these sites using the co-located eddy flux towers.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

We used the R package \texttt{neonSoilFlux} to estimate soil CO\(_2\)
fluxes with the flux-gradient method using data from buried soil sensors
at NEON terrestrial sites. We compared the predicted fluxes to those
measured directly using a field-based closed chamber approach. Soil
fluxes from \texttt{neonSoilFlux} were broadly effective at producing
estimates of flux comparable to those measured in the field using a
chamber-based technique. However \texttt{neonSoilFlux} outputs are quite
sensitive to a number of issues, including: missing data (and thus
gap-filling of input measurement datasets), the selection of soil depths
used to best calculate the gradient (which may vary between sites), and
finally the choice of method used for estimating soil diffusivity. The
flexibility of the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package allows the user to
evaluate each of these issues with site-specific knowledge and contexts.
Future refinements and subsequent validation of \texttt{neonSoilFlux}
outputs will feed forward into evaluating soil carbon fluxes broader
spatial scales to enhance understanding of the ways in which soils
across diverse ecosystems are responding to a changing climate.
